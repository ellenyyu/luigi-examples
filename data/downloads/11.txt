chapter i 


“are you quite sure?” mr  forbes laid down his newspaper  and
looked with slightly extended mouth at his daughter who leaned forward
in an attitude of suppressed energy  her hands clasped on the edge of
the breakfast table  the heiress of many millions was not handsome 
her features were large and her complexion dull  but she had the
carriage and ‘air’ of the new york girl of fashion  and wore a french
morning toilette which would have ameliorated a gorgon 

“quite sure  papa ”

“i suppose you have studied the question exhaustively ”

“oh  yes  indeed  i have read karl marx and henry george and a lot of
others  i suppose you have not forgotten that i belong to a club of
girls who aspire to be something more than fashionable butterflies  and
that we read together?”

“and you are also positive that you wish me to divide my fortune with
my fellow men  and deprive you of the pleasant position of heiress?”

“perfectly positive ” firmly  “it is terrible  terrible to think of the
starving thousands  i feel it my duty to tell you  papa  that if you do
not do this yourself  i shall  when  when  but i cannot even think of
that ”

“no  don’t worry about it  i’m good for twenty or thirty years yet    ”

“you are the handsomest and most distinguished looking man in new york ”

“thanks  to proceed  i should say that you are likely to be several
things meanwhile  i don’t know that i shall even take the trouble to
alter my will  still  i may  that is unless you convert me  and you are
also convinced that women should have the vote?”

“yes! yes! indeed i am  i know all the arguments for and against  i’ve
heard and read everything  you see  if we get the vote we can bring
socialism about quite easily ”

“without the slightest difficulty  i should say  considering the
homogeneity of the feminine mind ”

“you darling sarcastic thing  but can’t you see what weight such women
as we are interesting in the cause  must  have? we have carefully
excluded the  nouveau riche   only the very oldest and most
notable names will be on our petition when we get it up ”

“oh  you are going to get up a petition? well  let that pass for the
present  suppose you fall in love and want to marry?”

“i shall tell him everything  what i intend to make of my life  do
with what wealth i have at my disposal  if he does not sympathize
with me and agree to my plans  he must go  a woman’s chief end is not
matrimony ”

“i need not ask if you have ever been in love?”

“oh  of course  i want to be  dreadfully  all women do  even we
advanced women  now  papa! i don’t love you quite so well when you
smile like that  i am twenty one  and that is quite old for a girl who
has been highly educated  has travelled  and been out two years  i
have a right to call myself advanced  because i have gone deliberately
into the race  and have read up a great deal  even if i have as yet
accomplished nothing  exactly how much are you worth  papa?”

“broadly speaking  about thirty millions  as a great deal of that is in
railroad and other stock  i am liable to be worth much less any day 
much is also in land  which is worth only what it will bring  still  i
should say that i am reasonably sure of a fair amount ”

“it is terrible  papa! all that land! do give some of it at least
to the poor dear people  i assure you we feel that we have taken
them under our wing  and have grown quite sentimental over them  mr 
george would tell you what to do  at once  that man’s very baggy knees
fascinate me  he is so magnificently in earnest  when he scolded us all
for being rich  the other day at the meeting  i loved him ”

“it is a great relief to me that george is a married man  well  my
dear  your allowance is ten thousand dollars a year  do what you please
with it  and come to me if your fads and whims demand more  god forbid
that i should stand in the way of any woman’s happiness  by the by 
what does your mother think of this business?”

“she is  most  unsympathetic ”

“so i should imagine ” said mr  forbes  drily  “your mother is the
cleverest woman i know ”




chapter ii 


after luncheon  miss forbes hied herself to a drawing room
meeting in behalf of socialism  despite the fact that she had elected
the rôle of mental muscularity  she gave studious application to her
attire  her position and all that pertained to it were her enduring
religion  the interests of the flashing seasons were unconsciously
patronised rather than assimilated  as she walked up the avenue
toward the house of her friend  mrs  latimer burr  she looked like a
well grown lad masquerading in a very smart outfit of brown tweed  so
erect and soldierly was her carriage  so independent her little stride 
a bunch of violets was pinned to her muff  another at her throat  and
she wore a severe little toque instead of the picture hat she usually
affected 

she smiled as she swung along  and one or two women looked back
at her and sighed  she was quite happy  she had never known an
ungratified wish  she was spoken of in the newspapers as one of the few
intellectual young women in new york society  and now she had a really
serious object in life  she felt little spasms of gratification that
she had been born to set the world to rights  she and a few others  she
felt that she was not selfish  for she grudged no one a share in the
honours 

when she reached mrs  burr’s house  high on the avenue  and overlooking
the naked trees and the glittering white of the park  she found that
other toilettes had taken less time than hers  several of her friends
complimented the occasion with a punctuality which she commended
without envy 

the large drawing room  which was to be the scene of operations  was a
marvellous combination of every pale colour known to nature and art 
and looked expectant of white wigged dames  sparkling with satin and
diamonds  tripping the mazes of the minuet with gentlemen as courtly
as their dress was rich and colourous  but only a half dozen extremely
smart young women of the hoary nineteenth century sat in a group 
talking as fast as seals on a rock  and the slim little hostess was
compactly gowned in pearl grey cloth  her sleek head dressed in the
fashion of the moment 

she came forward  a lorgnette held close to her eyes  “how dear of
you  augusta  to be so prompt!” she said  kissing her lightly  “dear
me! i wish i could be as frightfully in earnest as the rest of you 
but for the life of me i can’t help feeling that it’s all a jolly good
lark  perhaps that’s the effect of my ex sister in law  patience
sparhawk  who says we are only playing at being alive  but we can’t
all have seventeen different experiences before we are twenty four 
including a sojourn in murders’ row  and a frantic love affair with
one’s own husband    ”

“tell me  hal  what is a woman like who has been through all that?”
interrupted augusta  her ears pricking with girlish curiosity  “is she
eccentric? does she look old  or something?”

“she’s not much like us ” said mrs  burr  briefly  “you’ll meet her
in time  it’s odd you never happened to  even if you weren’t out  of
course she can’t go out for awhile yet  it would hardly be good taste 
even if she wanted to ”

“how interestingly dreadful to have had such a thing in the family  but
i should think she would be just the one to take life seriously ”

“oh  she does  that’s the reason she doesn’t waste any time  here is
someone else  who is it?  oh  mary gallatin ”

augusta joined the group 

“where is mabel creighton?” demanded one of the girls  “i thought she
was coming with you ”

“haven’t you heard?” miss forbes  with an air of elaborate
indifference  drew her eyelids together as if to focus a half dozen
women that were entering  “the duke of bosworth arrives to day  and she
has stayed at home to receive him ”

“augusta! what do you mean?  what  duke of bosworth?”

“there is only one duke of the same name at a time  my dear  this
is the duke of bosworth of aire castle  and i suppose a half dozen
others  of the west riding  of the district of craven  of the county of
yorkshire  england  he has five other titles  i believe  and enjoys
the honour of the friendship of fletcher cuyler ”

“well!”

“mabel met him abroad  and got to know him quite well  and when he
wrote her that he should arrive to day  she thought it only hospitable
to stay at home and receive him ”

“are they engaged? augusta   do  be an angel ”

“i am sure i have not the slightest idea whether they are engaged or
not  mabel always has a flirtation on with somebody ”

“what is he like? how perfectly funny! how quiet she has kept him  is
he good looking  or  well  just like some of the others?”

“mabel has merely mentioned him to me  and i have not seen his
photograph ”

“she’d make a lovely bride  and mrs  creighton has such exquisite
taste  st  thomas’ would be a dream  i suppose he’ll wear a grey suit
with the trousers turned up and a pink shirt  i do hope he won’t walk
up the avenue with her with a big black cigar in his mouth ”

“is that what we came here to talk about?” asked miss forbes  severely 
“what difference does it make what a foreign titled thing looks like?
we are here to discuss a question which will one day exterminate the
entire order ”

“true ” exclaimed a dark haired distinguished looking girl who was
mainly responsible for the intellectual reputation of her set  albeit
not exempt from the witchery of fads  “we must stop gossiping and
attend to business  do you know that i am expected to speak? how am i
to collect my thoughts?”

“you have so many  alex ” said miss forbes  admiringly  “that it
wouldn’t matter if a few got loose  have you prepared your speech? i
have mine by heart ”

“i have thought it out  i don’t think i shall be frightened  it is
really such a very serious matter ”

“have you spoken to your father?”

“oh  we’ve talked it over  but i can’t say that he agrees with us ”

augusta laughed consciously  “there are probably some points of
similarity in our experiences  but we must be firm ”

some thirty women  gowned with fashionable simplicity  had arrived 
and were seated in a large double semi circle  they looked alert and
serious  mrs  burr drifted aimlessly about for a moment  then paused
before a table and tapped it smartly with her lorgnette 

“i suppose we may as well begin ” she said  “i believe we are going
to discuss to day the  a  the advisability of women having the
vote  franchise  also socialism  miss maitland  who has thoroughly
digested both subjects  and many more  has kindly consented to speak 
and dr  broadhead is coming in later to give us one of his good
scoldings  alexandra  will you open the ball?”

“hal  you are incorrigible ” exclaimed miss maitland  drawing her dark
brows together  “at least you might pretend to be in earnest  we think
it very good of you to lend us your house  and we are delighted that
you managed dr  broadhead so cleverly  but we don’t wish to be flouted 
for we  at least  are in earnest ”

“alexis  if you scold me  i shall cry  and i’ll now be serious  i swear
it  you know i admire you to death  your french poetry is adorable 
you have more ideas for decorating than any professional in new york 
and you fence like a real amazon  i am simply dying to hear you make a
speech  but first let me see if latimer is hiding anywhere ”

she went out into the hall and returned in a moment  “it would be just
like latimer to get fletcher cuyler and listen  and then guy us  now 
alexandra  proceed ” and she seated herself  and applied her lorgnette
to her bright quizzical eyes 

miss maitland  somewhat embarrassed by her introduction  stepped to the
middle of the room and faced her audience  she gave a quick sidelong
glance at her skirts  they stood out like a yacht under full sail 
she was a fine looking girl  far above woman’s height  with dignified
features  a bright happy expression  and a soft colour  she was a
trifle nervous  and opened her jacket to gain time  throwing it back 

“that’s a paquin blouse ” whispered a girl confidently to augusta 

“sh h!” said miss forbes severely 

miss maitland showed no further symptom of nervousness  she clasped her
hands lightly and did not make a gesture nor shift her position during
her speech  her repose was very impressive 

“i think we should vote ” she said decidedly  “it will not be agreeable
in many respects  and will heavily increase our responsibilities  but
the reasons for far outweigh those against  a good many of us have
money in our own names  we all have large allowances  some day we may
have the terrible responsibility of great wealth  the income tax is in
danger of being defeated  if we get the vote  we may do much toward
making it a law  and it is a move in the right direction towards
socialism  our next must be towards persuading the government to take
the railroads  it is shocking that the actual costs of transit should
be so small  the charges so exorbitant and the profits so enormous 
i feel this so oppressively that every time i make a long journey by
rail  i give the equivalent of my fare to the poor at once  it is a
horrifying thing that we on this narrow island of new york city should
live like hothouse plants in the midst of a malarious swamp  that
almost at our back doors the poor are living  whole families in one
room  and on one meal a day  my father gives me many thousands a year
for charity  but charity is not the solution of the problem  there must
be a redistribution of wealth  of course i have no desire to come down
to poverty  i am physically unfit for it  as are all of us  we should
have sufficient left to insure our comfort  but any woman with brain
can get along without the more extravagant luxuries  it is time that we
did something to justify our existence  and if the law required that
we worked two or three hours a day instead of leading the idle life of
pleasure that we do    ”

“we are ornamental  that is something ” exclaimed a remarkably pretty
woman  “i am sure the people outside love to read about and look at us 
society gossip is not written for  us  ”

miss maitland smiled  “you certainly are ornamental  mary ” she said 
“but fancy how much more interesting you would be if you were useful as
well ”

“i’d lose my good looks ”

“well  you can’t keep them forever  you should cultivate a substitute
meanwhile  and then you never need be driven back into the ranks
of  passée   disappointed women  faded beauties are a bore to
everybody ”

“i refuse to contemplate such a prospect  alex  you are getting to be a
horrid rude advanced new woman ”

mrs  burr clapped her hands  “how delightful!” she cried  “i didn’t
know we were to have a debate ”

“now keep quiet  all of you ” said miss maitland  “i have not
finished  mary gallatin  don’t you interrupt me again  now that we
understand this question so thoroughly  we must have more recruits  of
course  hundreds of women of the upper class are signing the petition
asking for the extension of the franchise to our sex  but few of them
are interested in socialism  and if it is to be brought about  it
must be by us  i have little faith in the rag tag bob tail element at
present enlisted in that cause  they not only carry little weight with
the more intelligent part of the community  but i have been assured
that they would not fight  that they take it out in talk  that if
ever there was a great upheaval  they would let the anarchists do the
killing  and then step in  and try to get control later 

“now  i thoroughly despise a coward  so do all women  and i have no
faith in the propagandism of men that won’t fight  what we must do
is to enlist our men  they are luxurious now  and love all that
pertains to wealth  but  as wellington said once of the same class in
england  ‘the puppies can fight!’ not that our men are puppies  don’t
misunderstand me  but you know what i mean  they would only seem so to
a man who had spent his life in the saddle 

“it has been said that the civil war took our best blood  and that
that is the reason we have no great men now  all the most gallant and
high minded and ambitious were killed  although i don’t forget that
mr  forbes could be anything that he chose  i suppose he thinks that
american statesmanship has fallen so low that he scorns to come out
avowedly as the head of his party  and merely amuses himself pulling
the wires  but i feel positive that if a tremendous crisis ever arose 
it would be mr  forbes who would unravel the snarl  you can tell him
that  augusta  with my compliments 

“now  i have come to the real point of what i have to say  it was first
suggested to me by helena belmont when she was on here last  and it
has taken a strong hold on my mind  we must awaken the soul in our
men  that is what they lack  the germ is there  but it has not been
developed  perhaps i should say that the soul of the american people
rose to its full flower during the civil war  and then withered in
the reaction  and in the commercial atmosphere which has since fitted
our nation closer than its own skin  miss belmont says that nothing
will arouse the men but another war  that they will be nothing but a
well fed body with a mental annex until they once more have a ‘big
atmosphere’ to expand in  but i don’t wholly agree with her  and the
thought of another such sacrifice is appalling  i believe that the
higher qualities in man can be roused more surely by woman than by
bloodshed  and that if we  the women of new york  the supposed orchids 
butterflies  or whatever people choose to call us  whose luxury is the
cynosure and envy of the continent  could be instrumental in giving
back to the nation its lost spiritual quality  understand  please 
that i do not use the word in its religious sense  it would be a far
greater achievement than any for which the so called emancipated women
are vociferating  the vote is a minor consideration  if we acquire
the influence over men that we should  we shall not need it  and
personally  i should dispense with it with great pleasure ”

“bravo! young lady ” exclaimed a vibrating resonant voice  and a
clerical man entered the room to the clapping of many hands  his eyes
were keen and restless  his hair and beard black and silver  and there
was a curious disconcerting bald spot on his chin  he looked ready to
burst with energy 

“thank you all very much  but don’t clap any more  for i have only a
few minutes to spare  how do you do  mrs  burr? yes  that was a very
good speech  i have been eavesdropping  you see  feminine  but i am
the last to quarrel with that  it is not necessary for a woman to be
logical so long as her instincts are in the right direction  well  i
will say a few words to you  but they must be few as i am very hoarse 
i have been speaking all day ” he strode about as he talked  and
occasionally smote his hands together  he was a very emphatic speaker 
and  like all crusaders  somewhat theatrical 

“i agree with all that miss maitland has said to you  with the
exception of her views on socialism  i don’t believe socialism to
be the solution of our loathsome municipal degradation nor of the
universal social evil  but i have no time to go into that question
to day  the other part  that you must awaken the soul of the men of
your class  i most heartily endorse  the gentlemen alone can save
this country  snatch it from the hands of plebeians and thieves  in
them alone lies the hope of american regeneration  when i read of a
strapping young man who has been educated at harvard  or yale  or
princeton  who is an expert boxer  fencer  whip  oarsman  yachtsman 
addicted to all manly sport  in fact  when i read of such a man
having tortoise shell brushes with diamond monograms  diamond garter
buckles  and thirty sets of silk pyjamas  never see their names in
the paper except as ushers at weddings  or as having added some new
trifle to their costly apartments  it makes me sick  sick! a war
would rouse these young men  as miss maitland suggests  i haven’t the
slightest doubt that they would fight magnificently  and that those
who survived would be serious and useful men for the rest of their
lives  but we don’t want war  and you must do the rousing  make them
vote  vote  nullify the thieving lying cormorants who are fattening on
your country  and ruining it morally and financially  as well as making
it the scorn and jest of europe  and make them vote  not only this
year  but every year for the rest of their lives  and on every possible
question  it is to be hoped  indeed  that no war will come to awaken
their manhood  we don’t want to pay so hideous a price as that  and it
is shocking that it has been found necessary to suggest it  but what we
do want is a great moral war  lash them into that  and see that they
do not break ranks until they have honest men in the legislature  in
congress  and in every municipal office in the country  now  i must be
off ” and waving a hasty adieu  he shot out 

“for my part ” said mrs  burr  above the enthusiastic chorus  “i
am delighted that he didn’t uphold socialism  i’ll undertake the
reformation of latimer  although it will probably give me wrinkles and
turn me grey  but i won’t have him giving up his ‘boodle ’ as they say
out west  not i! not i!”

“gally is hopeless ” said that famous clubman’s wife  with a sigh  “i
shall have to work on someone else ”

“it will be lots more interesting ” murmured her neighbour 

“how shall we begin?” asked mrs  burr  wrinkling her smooth brow  “put
them on gruel and hot water for awhile? i am sure they are hopeless so
long as they eat and drink so much ”

“i suppose all we girls will have to marry ” remarked one of them 

“well  you would  anyhow ” said mrs  burr  consolingly 

“i shall not marry until i find the right man ” said augusta firmly 
“not if i die an old maid  but father would be a splendid convert  and
his name would carry great weight ”

“you mean for socialism ” replied her hostess  “no man does his
political duty more religiously than mr  forbes  but let us send
socialism to  ahem  and just work at the other thing  i am dying to see
how latimer will take it ”

“never!” exclaimed augusta  and was echoed loyally  “we must not lose
sight of that  i don’t at all agree with dr  broadhead on that point 
i have fully made up my mind to bring papa round ”

“but you are at a disadvantage  darling ” said mrs  burr  drily  “your
beautiful mamma thinks we are all a pack of idiots  and your father has
a great respect for her opinion  to say nothing of being more or less
 épris  ”

“i shall convert her too ” said augusta sturdily 

mrs  burr laughed outright  “i can just see mrs  forbes posing as a
prophet of socialism  well  let us eat  alexis  you must be limp all
the way down  and your thinker must be fairly staggering  i will pour
you a stiff cup of tea and put some rum in it ”

augusta rose  “i must go  hal ” she said  “i have a speech to make
myself in the slums  you know  aren’t you coming?”

“i? god forbid! but do take something before you go  it may save you
from stage fright ”

“i haven’t a minute  i must be there in twenty  who is coming with me?”

eight or ten of the company rose and hurried out with her  the rest
gathered about the tea table and relieved their mental tension in
amicable discussion of the lighter matters of the day 




chapter iii 


a footman had taken the duke of bosworth’s cards up to miss
mabel creighton and her mother  the young man had arrived but an hour
before and still wore his travelling gear  but had been given to
understand that an english peer was welcome in a new york drawing room
on any terms  the drawing room in which he awaited the american maiden
who had taken his attenuated fancy was large and sumptuous and very
expensive  there were tables of ormolu  and cabinets of tortoise shell
containing collections of cameos  fens and miniatures  a  lapis
lazuli  clock three feet high  and a piano inlaid with twenty seven
different woods  the walls were frescoed by a famous hand  and there
were lamps and candle brackets and various articles of decoration
which must have been picked up in extensive travels 

the duke noted everything with his slow listless gaze  he sat forward
on the edge of his chair  his chin pressed to the head of his stick  he
was a small delicately built man  of thirty or more  his shoulders had
rounded slightly  his cheeks and lower lip were beginning to droop  the
pale blue eyes were dim  the lids red  he was a debauchee  but “a good
sort ” and men liked him 

he did not move during the quarter of an hour he was kept waiting  but
when the  portière  was pushed aside he rose quickly  and went
forward with much grace and charm of manner  the girl who entered was a
dainty blonde fluffy creature  and looked like a bit of fragile china
in the palatial room 

“how sweet of you to come so soon ” she said  with frank pleasure  “i
did not expect you for an hour yet  mamma will be down presently  she
is quite too awfully anxious to meet you ”

the duke resumed his seat and leaned back this time  regarding miss
creighton through half closed eyes  his expression was much the same as
when he had inventoried the room 

“i came to america to see you ” he said 

the colour flashed to her hair  but she smiled gracefully  “how funny!
just as if you had run over to pay me an afternoon call  did the trip
bore you much?”

“i am always bored at sea when i am not ill  i am usually ill ”

“oh! really? how horrid! i am never ill  i always find the trip rather
jolly  i go over to shop  and that would keep me up if nothing else
did  well  i think it was very good indeed of you  awfully good  to
brave the horrors of the deep  or rather of your state room  just to
call on me ”

she had a babyish voice and a delightful manner  the duke smiled  he
was really rather glad to see her again  “you were good enough to ask
me to call if i ever came over ” he said  “and it occurred to me that
it would be a jolly thing to do  i only had little detached chats with
you over there  and there were always a lot of johnnies hanging about 
i felt interested to see you in your own surroundings ”

“oh  perhaps you are going to write a book? i have always felt
dreadfully afraid that you were clever  well  don’t make the mistake of
thinking that we have only one type over here  as they always do when
they come to write us up  there are just ten girls in my particular
set  we have sets within sets  as you do  you know  and we are each one
of us quite different from all the others  we are supposed to be the
intellectual set  and alexandra maitland and augusta forbes are really
frightfully clever  i don’t know why they tolerate me  probably because
i admire them  augusta is my dearest friend  alex pats me on the head
and says that i am the leaven that keeps them from being a sodden lump
of grey matter  i have addled my brains trying to keep up with them ”

“don’t  you are much more charming as you are ”

“oh  dear! i don’t know  men always seem to get tired of me ” she
replied  with just how much ingenuousness the duke could not determine 
“mrs  burr says it is because i talk a blue streak and say nothing 
hal is quite too frightfully slangy  augusta kisses me and says i
am an inconsequential darling  she made me act in one of howell’s
comedies once  and i did it badly on purpose  in the hope of raising my
reputation  but augusta said it was because i couldn’t act  fletcher
cuyler  who is the most impertinent man in new york said     have you
seen fletcher?”

“he came out on the tug to meet me  and left me at the door ”

“i believe if fletcher really has a deep down affection for anyone 
it is for you  i mean for any man  he is devoted to all of us  and he
is the only man we chum with  but we wouldn’t have him at the meeting
to day  do you know that i should have lent my valuable presence to two
important meetings this afternoon?”

“really?” the duke was beginning to feel a trifle restless 

“yes  we are going in frightfully for socialism  you know  socialism
and the vote  and  oh  dozens of other things  alex said we must  and
so we did  it’s great fun  we make speeches  at least  i don’t  but the
others do  should you like to go to one of our meetings?”

“i should not!” said the duke emphatically 

“well  you must not make fun of us  for i am simply bent on having
all the girls adore you  particularly augusta  the other day we had
a lovely meeting  it was here  i have the prettiest boudoir  alex
designed it  it looks just like a rainbow  i lay on the couch in a gown
to match  and the girls all took off their stiff street frocks and put
on my wrappers  and we smoked cigarettes and ate bon bons  and read
karl marx  it was lovely! i didn’t understand a word  but i  felt 
intellectual  the atmosphere  you know  when we had finished a chapter
and alex had expounded it  and quarrelled over it with augusta  we
talked over all the men we knew  and i am sure men would be lots
better if they knew what girls thought about them  alex says we must
regenerate them  quicken their souls  so to speak  and i suppose i
may as well begin on you  although you’re not an american  and can’t
vote  we’re for reforming the united states  you know  what is the
state of your soul?” and again she gave her fresh childlike laugh 

“i haven’t any  give me up  i am hopeless ” he was arriving at the
conclusion that she was more amusing in detached chats  but reflected
that she was certainly likeable  it was this last pertainment  added to
the rumour of her father’s vast wealth  that had brought him across the
water 

“i don’t know that i have ever seen one of the  what do they call
them?  advanced women? but i am told that they are not circean  that 
indeed  seems to be their hall mark  a woman’s first duty is to be
attractive ”

“that’s what fletcher says  augusta is my most intimate friend  my
very dearest friend  but i never saw a man look as if he was thinking
about falling in love with her  how long shall you stay?” she added
quickly  perceiving that he was tiring of the subject 

“i?  oh  i don’t know  until you tell me that i bore you  i may take a
run into central america with fletcher ”

“into what? why that’s days  and days  and days from here  and must be
a horrid place to travel in ”

“i thought chicago was only twenty four hours from new york ”

“oh  you funny  funny  deliciously funny englishman! why central
america doesn’t belong to the united states at all  it’s ’way down
between north and south america or somewhere  i suppose you mean middle
america  we call chicago and all that part of the country west ”

“if it’s middle it’s central ” said the duke  imperturbably  “you
cannot expect me to command the vernacular of your enormous country in
a day ”

he rose suddenly  a woman some twenty years older than mabel had
entered  her face and air were excessively  almost aggressively
refined  her carriage complacent  a trifle insolent  she was the faded
prototype of her daughter  the resemblance was close and prophetic 

“my dear duke ” she said  shaking him warmly by the hand  “i am so
flattered that you have come to us at once  and so glad to have the
opportunity to thank you for your kindness to mabel when she was in
your dear delightful country  take that chair  it is so much more
comfortable ” she herself sat upon an upright chair  and laid one
hand lightly over the other  her repose of manner was absolute  “the
happiest days of my life were spent in england  when i was first
married  it seems only day before yesterday  my husband and i went
over and jaunted about england and scotland and wales in the most
old fashioned manner possible  for six months we rambled here and
there  seeing everything  one was not ashamed of being a tourist in
those days  we would not present a letter  we wanted to have a real
honeymoon  we were so much in love  and to think that aire castle is so
near that terrible strid  i remember that we stood for an hour simply
fascinated  mr  creighton wanted to take the stride  but i wouldn’t
let him  he has never been over with me since  he is so busy  i can’t
think how mr  forbes always manages to go with his wife  unless it is
true that he is jealous of her  although in common justice i must add
that if she has ever given him cause no one knows it  i suppose it is
on general principles  because she is such a beauty  still i must say
that if i were a man and married to a southern woman i should want to
get rid of her occasionally  they  are  so conceited and they do
rattle on so about nothing  virginia forbes talks rather less than
most southern women  but i imagine that is to enhance the value of her
velvety voice ”

the duke  who had made two futile efforts to rise  now stood up
resolutely 

“i am very sorry    ” he began 

“oh!  i  am so sorry you  will  rush away ” exclaimed his
hostess  “i have barely heard you speak  you must come with us to the
opera to night  do  will you come informally to an early dinner  or
will you join us in the box with fletcher?”

“i will join you with fletcher  and i must go  i have an engagement
with him at the hotel  he is waiting for me  you are very kind  thanks 
awfully  so jolly to be so hospitably received in a strange country ”

when he reached the side walk  he drew a long breath  “my god!” he
thought  “is it a disease that waxes with age? perhaps they get wound
up sometimes and can’t stop     and she is pretty now  but it’s
dreadful to have the inevitable sprung on you in that way  what are
the real old women like  i wonder? they must merely fade out like an
old photograph  i can’t imagine one of them a substantial corpse  i
shall feel as if i were married to a dissolving view  she is charming
now  but  oh  well  that is not the only thing to be taken into
consideration ”

the creighton house was on murray hill  he crossed over to fifth avenue
and walked down toward the waldorf  absently swinging his stick 
regardless of many curious glances  “i wonder ” he thought  “i wonder
if i ever dreamed of a honeymoon with the one woman  if i did  i have
forgotten  what a bore it will be now ”




chapter iv 


augusta returned home at six o’clock  not flushed with triumph 
for she was too tired  but with an elated spirit  she had stood
on a platform in an east side hall surrounded by her friends 
and to two dozen bedraggled females had made the first speech of
her life  and it had been a good speech  she did not need assurance
of that  she had stood as well as alexandra maitland  but had used
certain little emphatic gestures (she was too independent to imitate
anyone)  and she had  with well bred lack of patronage  assured her
humble sisters  for three quarters of an hour  that they must sign the
petition for woman franchise  and make all the other women on the east
side sign it  in order that they might be able to put down the liquor
trust  reform their husbands  secure good government  and be happy
ever after  she flattered herself that she had not used a single long
word  and she prided herself upon her vocabulary  that she had spoken
with the simplicity and directness which characterized great orators
and writers  altogether  it was an experience to make any girl scorn
fatigue  and when she entered her boudoir and found mabel creighton 
she gave her a dazzling smile of welcome  and embraced her warmly 
mabel responded with a nervous hug and shed a tear 

“he’s here!” she whispered ecstatically 

“who?  oh  your duke  did he propose right off? do tell me ” and
she seated herself close beside her friend  and forgot that she was
reforming the united states 

“no  but he told me that he had come over on purpose to see me ”

“that’s equal to a proposal ” said augusta decidedly  “englishmen are
very cautious  they are much better brought up than ours  which is only
another warning that we must take ours in hand  it is shocking the way
they frivol  i’d rather you married an american for this reason  but if
you love the duke of bosworth  i have nothing to say  besides  you’re
the vine and tendril sort  i don’t know that you’d ever acquire any
influence over a man  so it doesn’t much matter  now tell me about the
duke  dearest  i am so glad that he has come ”

mabel talked a steady stream for a half hour  then hurried home to
dress for the evening 

mr  forbes was standing before the fire in the drawing room when his
daughter entered  apparelled for the opera and subsequent ball  she
wore a smart french gown of pale blue satin  a turquoise comb in her
pale modishly dressed hair  and she carried herself with the spring and
grace of her kind  but she was very pale  and there were dark circles
about her eyes 

“you look worn out  my dear ” said her father  solicitously  “what have
you been doing?”

miss forbes sank into a chair  “i went to two meetings  one at hal’s
and one in the slums  i spoke for the first time  and it has rather
taken it out of me ”

“would the victory of your ‘cause’ compensate for crow’s feet?”

“indeed it would  i really do not care  i am so glad that i have no
beauty to lose  i might not take life so seriously if i had  i am
beginning to have a suspicion that mary gallatin and several others
have merely taken up these great questions as a fad  here comes mamma 
i am glad  for i am hungry  i had no time for tea to day ”

a  portière  was lifted aside by a servant  and mrs  forbes
entered the room  but for the majesty of her carriage she looked
younger than her daughter  so exquisitely chiselled were her features 
so fresh and vivid her colouring  virginia forbes was thirty nine and
looked less than thirty  her tall voluptuous figure had not outgrown a
line of its early womanhood  her neck and arms were greek  a virginian
by birth  she inherited her high bred beauty from a line of ancestors
that had been fathered in america by one of elizabeth’s courtiers 
her eyes had the slight fullness peculiar to the southern woman  the
colour  like that of the hair  was a dark brown warmed with a touch
of red  her curved  scarlet mouth was not full  but the lips were
rarely without a pout  which lent its aid to the imperious charm of her
face  there were those who averred that upon the rare occasions when
this lovely mouth was off guard it showed a hint in its modelling of
self will and cruelty  but few had seen it off guard 

she wore a tiara of diamonds  and on her neck three rows of large
stones depending lightly from fine gold chains  her gown was of pale
green velvet  with a stomacher of diamonds  on her arm she carried an
opera cloak of emerald green velvet lined with blue fox 

mr  forbes’ cold brilliant eyes softened and smiled as she came toward
him  flirting her lashes and lifting her chin  for this man  whose
eyes were steel during all the hours of light  who controlled the
destinies of railroads and other stupendous enterprises and was the
back bone of his political party  who had piled up millions as a
child piles up blocks  and who had three times refused the nomination
of his party for the highest gift of the nation  had worshipped his
wife for twenty two years  he turned toward his home at the close of
each day with a pleasure that never lost its edge  exulting in the
thought that ambition  love of admiration  and the onerous duties
of the social leader could not tempt his wife to neglect him for an
hour  he lavished fortunes upon her  she had an immense allowance to
squander without record  a palace at newport and another in the north
carolina mountains  a yacht  and jewels to the value of a million
dollars  in all the years of their married life he had refused her
but one dear desire  to live abroad in the glitter of courts  and
receive the homage of princes  he had declined foreign missions again
and again  “the very breath of life for me is in america ” he had
said with final decision  “and if i wanted office i should prefer the
large responsibilities of the presidency to the nagging worries of an
ambassador’s life  the absurdities of foreign etiquette irritate me
now when i can come and go as i like  if they were my daily portion i
should end in a lunatic asylum  they are a lot of tin gods  anyhow 
my dear  as for you  it is much more notable to shine as a particular
star in a country of beauties  than to walk away from a lot of women
who look as if they had been run through the same mould  and are only
beauties by main strength ” and on this point she was forced to submit 
she did it with the better grace because she loved her husband with the
depth and tenacity of a strong and passionate nature  his brain and
will  the nobility and generosity of his character  had never ceased
to exercise their enchantment  despite the men that paid her increasing
court  moreover  although the hard relentless pursuit of gold had aged
his hair and skin  mr  forbes was a man of superb appearance  his
head and features had great distinction  his face  when the hours of
concentration were passed  was full of magnetism and life  his eyes
of good will and fire  his slender powerful figure betrayed little
more than half of his fifty one years  he was a splendid specimen of
the american of the higher civilisation  with all the vitality and
enthusiasm of youth  the wide knowledge and intelligence of more than
his years  and a manner that could be polished and cold  or warm and
spontaneous  at will 

for her daughter  mrs  forbes cared less  she had not the order of
vanity which would have dispensed with a walking advertisement of her
years  but she resented having borne an ugly duckling  one  moreover 
that had tiresome fads  she had been her husband’s confidante in
all his gigantic schemes  financial and political  and augusta’s
intellectual kinks bored her 

she crossed the room and gave her husband’s necktie a little twist  mr 
forbes sustained the reputation of being the best groomed man in new
york  but it pleased her to think that she could improve him  then she
fluttered her eyelashes again 

“do i look very beautiful?” she whispered 

he bent his head and kissed her 

“when you two get through spooning ” remarked miss forbes in a tired
voice  “suppose we go in to dinner ”

“don’t flatter yourself that it is all for you ” mrs  forbes said to
her husband  “i am to meet an english peer to night ”

“indeed ” replied mr  forbes  smiling  “have we another on the market?
what is his price? does he only want a roof? or will he take the whole
castle  barring the name and the outside walls?”

“you are such an old cynic  this is the duke of bosworth  a very
charming man  i am told  i don’t know whether he is poverty stricken or
not  i believe he paid mabel creighton a good deal of attention in the
autumn  when she was visiting in england ”

“he wouldn’t get much with her  creighton is in a tight place  he may
pull out  but he has three children besides mabel  however  there are
plenty of others to snap at this titled fish  no doubt ”

“i hope not ” said augusta  “dear mabel is very fond of him  i am sure
of that  he only arrived to day  and is going with them to the opera
to night  how are you to meet him?”

“fletcher cuyler will bring him to my box  of course  are not all
distinguished foreigners brought to my shrine at once?”

“true ” said miss forbes  “but  are  we going in to dinner? i have
never heard maurel in  don giovanni   and i don’t want to lose
more than the first act ”

“there is plenty of it  but let us go in to dinner  by all means ”




chapter v 


the two tiers of boxes at the metropolitan opera house reserved
for the beauty and fashion of new york flashed with the plumage
of women and a thousand thousand gems  women of superb style  with
little of artifice but much of art  gowned so smartly that only
their intense vitality saved them from confusion with the fashion plate 
carrying themselves with a royal  albeit somewhat self conscious air 
many of them crowned like empresses  others starred like night 
producing the effect  en masse  of resplendent beauty  and individually
of deficiency in all upon which the centuries have set their seal 
hung  two or three in a frame  against the curving walls and red
background of the great house  suspended in air  these goddesses
of a new civilisation  as if with insolent challenge to all that
had come to stare  to the music they paid no attention  they had
come to decorate  not to listen  without them there would be no opera 
the music lovers were stuffed on high  where they seemed to cling to
the roof like flies  the people in the parquette and orchestra chairs 
in the dress circle and balconies  came to see the hundreds of millions
represented in the grand tier  two rows of  blasé  club faces studded
the long omnibus box  behind the huge sleeves and voluminous skirts
that sheathed their proudest possessions  were the men that had coined
or inherited the wealth which made this triumphant exhibition possible 

as the curtain went down on the second act and the boxes emptied
themselves of their male kind that other male kind might enter to do
homage  two young men took their stand in the back of a box near the
stage and scanned the house  one of them remarked after a few moments 

“i thought that all american women were beautiful  so far  i see only
one ”

“these are the new york fashionettes  my dear boy  their pedigree is
too short for aristocratic outline  you will observe that the pug is
as yet unmitigated  not that blood always tells  by any means  some of
your old duchesses look like cooks  our orchids travel on their style 
grooming  and health  and you must admit that the general effect is
stunning  who is your beauty?”

“directly in the middle of the house  gad! she’s a ripper ”

“you are right  that is the prettiest woman in new york  and her
pedigree is probably as good as yours ”

“who is she?”

“mrs  edward r  forbes  the wife of one of the wealthiest and most
powerful men in the united states ”

“really!”

“that is her daughter beside her ”

“her what!”

“i always enjoy making that shot  it throws a flash light on the
pitiful lack of originality in man every time  but it is nothing for
the petted wife of an american millionaire to look thirty when she is
forty  it’s the millionaire who looks sixty when he is fifty  i’m not
including forbes  by the way  that tall man of fine physique that has
just left the box is he ”

“poor thing!”

“oh  don’t waste any pity on forbes  he’s the envy of half new york 
she is devoted to him  and with good reason  there are few men that
can touch him at any point  i shall take you over presently  the first
thing a distinguished stranger  who has had the tip  does when he
comes to new york is to pay his court at that shrine  what a pity you
are booked  that girl will come in for forty millions ”

the other set his face more stolidly 

“pounds?”

“oh  no  dollars  but they’ll do ”

“i have not spoken as yet  although i don’t mind saying that that is
what i came over for ”

“i suppose you are in pretty deep  too deep to draw out?”

“i don’t know that i want to  i can be frank with you  fletcher  is
her father solid? american fortunes are so deucedly ricketty  i am
perfectly willing to state brutally that i wouldn’t  couldn’t  marry
venus unless i got a half million (pounds) with her and something of an
income to boot ”

“as far as i know creighton stands pretty well toward the top  you
can never tell though  american fortunes are so exaggerated  you
see  the women whose husbands are worth five millions can make pretty
much the same splurge as the twenty or thirty million ones  they know
so well how to do it  for the matter of that there’s one clever old
 parvenu  here who has never handled more than a million and a
half  as i happen to know  for i’m her lawyer  and who entertains
with the best of them  her house  clothes  jewels  are gorgeous 
a shrewd old head like that can do a lot on an income of seventy
thousand dollars a year  but forbes  i should say  is worth his twenty
millions  that’s allowing for all embellishments  if he’s worth a
dollar  and augusta is the only child  unless america goes bankrupt 
she’ll come in for two thirds of that one of these days  and an immense
dot meanwhile ”

at this moment miss creighton  who had been talking with charming
vivacity to a group of visitors  dismissed them with tactful badinage 
and beckoned to the two men in the back of the box 

“sit down ” she commanded  “what do you think  fletcher? i stayed away
from two important meetings to day in order to receive the duke  was
not that genuine american hospitality?”

she spoke lightly  but as her eyes sought the englishman’s  something
seemed to flutter behind her almost transparent face 

“these fads! these fads!” exclaimed the young man addressed as
fletcher  “have you resigned yourself to the new woman  bertie? the
new york variety is innocuous  they just have a real good time and the
newspapers take them seriously and write them up  which they think is
lovely ”

“nobody pays any attention to fletcher cuyler ” said miss creighton
with affected disdain  “we will make you all stare yet ”

the duke smiled absently  he was looking toward the box in the middle
of the tier 

“i think women should have whatever diversion they can find or invent ”
he said  “society does not do much for them ”

the curtain rose 

“keep quiet ” ordered cuyler  “i allow no talking in a box which i
honour with my presence  that isn’t what  i  ruin myself for ”

he was a tail nervous blonde bald headed man of the duke’s age  with
an imp like expression and dazzling teeth  despite the fact that he
was unwealthed  he was a fixed star in new york society  he not only
knew more dukes and princes than any other man in the united states 
but was intimate with them  he had smart english relatives and was a
graduate of oxford  where he had been the chosen friend of the heir to
the dukedom of bosworth  his excessive liveliness  his adaptability and
versatility  his audacity  eccentricities  cleverness  and his utter
disregard of rank  had made him immensely popular in england  he was
treated as something between a curio and a spoilt child  and if people
guessed occasionally that his head was peculiarly level  they but
approved him the more 

when the act was done and the box again invaded  cuyler carried the
englishman off to call on mrs  forbes  her box was already crowded 
and mr  forbes stood just outside the door  as the duke was introduced
to him  he contracted his eyelids  and a brief glance of contempt shot
from eyes that looked twenty years younger than the fish like orbs
which involuntarily twitched as they met that dart  but mr  forbes
was always courteous  and he spoke pleasantly to the young man of his
father  whom he had known 

cuyler entered the box  “get out ” he said  “everyone of you  i’ve got
a live duke out there  he’s mortgaged for the rest of the evening and
time’s short ” he drove the men out  then craned his long neck round
the half open door 

“dukee  dukee ” he called  “come hither ”

the duke  summoning what dignity he could  entered  and was presented 
after he had paid a few moments’ court to mrs  forbes  cuyler deftly
changed seats with him and plunged into an animated dispute with his
hostess anent the vanishing charms of  don giovanni  

the duke leaned over miss forbes’ chair with an air of languor  which
was due to physical fatigue  contemplating her absently  and not
taking the trouble to more than answer her remarks  nevertheless  his
prolonged if indifferent stare disturbed the girl who had known little
susceptibility to men  there was something in the cold regard of his
eye  the very weariness of his manner  which had its charm for the type
of woman who is responsive to the magnetism of inertia  whom a more
vital force repels  and his title  all that it represented  the pages
of military glory it rustled  appealed to the mind of the american girl
who had felt the charm of english history  she was not a snob  she
had given no thought to marrying a title  and if the man had repelled
her  she would have relegated him to that far outer circle whence all
were banished who bored her or achieved her disapproval  but a thin
spell emanated from this cold self contained personality and stirred
her languid pulse  practical as she was  she had a girl’s imagination 
and she saw in him all that he had not  haloed with an ancient title 
behind him a great sweep of historical canvas  then she remembered her
friend  and envied her with the most violent emotion of her life 

“well  what do you think of her?” asked cuyler of the duke  as they
walked down the lobby  “i don’t mean  la belle dame sans merci  
there’s only one opinion on that subject  but augusta? do you think you
could stand her? if forbes took the notion he’d come down with five
million dollars without turning a hair ”

“i could swallow her whole and without a grimace ” said the duke drily 
“but i am half  two thirds committed  i have no intention of making
miss creighton ridiculous  although i shall be obliged to tell her
father frankly that i cannot marry her unless he comes down with half
a million  it’s a disgusting thing to do  but i have no choice ”

“oh  don’t go back on mabel  of course  but i am sorry  however 
 nous verrons   if creighton doesn’t come to time  let me know 
i am pretty positive i can arrange the other  i think i know my fair
compatriot’s weak spot  i suppose you go on with the creightons to the
big affair at the schemmerhorn smiths to night? well  give augusta a
quarter of an hour or so of your flattering attentions  it will do no
harm  in any event  i feel like a conspirator  but i’d like to see you
on your feet  gad! i wish i had a title  i wouldn’t be in debt as long
as you have been ”




chapter vi 


the next day cuyler took the duke to call on mrs  forbes
in her house  it was five o’clock and the lamps were lit  augusta’s
particular set were there  talking socialism over their tea  and
enlightening a half dozen young men and elderly club  roués   who
listened with becoming gravity  mrs  forbes sat somewhat apart by the
tea table talking to three or four men on any subject but socialism 
she wore a gown of dark red velvet with a collar of venetian lace and
sat in a large high backed chair of ebony  inlaid with ivory  the seat
was also high  and she looked somewhat like a queen on her throne 
graciously receiving the homage of her courtiers  the drawing room
was twice as large as the creighton’s  the duke noted as he entered 
it was hung with dark green velvet embroidered with a tree design in
wood colour an inch thick  every shade of green blended in the great
apartment  and there was no other colour but the wood relief and the
pink of the lamp shades 

mrs  forbes did not rise  but she held out her hand to the stranger
with so spontaneous a warmth that he felt as if he were receiving his
first welcome in transatlantic parts  she had not shaken hands with him
at the opera  and their brief conversation had been over her shoulder 
he now found that her eyes and hand  her womanly magnetism and almost
regal manner combined to effect the impression  “new york   c’est
moi   my hospitality to the elect few who win my favour is sincere
and unbounded  the bitter envy of the cold and superfluous stranger
without its gates  and  of all men  my dear duke of bosworth  you are
the most genuinely welcome ”

he wondered a little how she did it  but did not much care  it was a
large beautiful gracious presence  and he was content  glad to bask in
it  he forgot augusta and mabel  and took a low chair before her 

“i won’t ask you how you like new york ” she said  smiling again  she
half divined his thoughts  and saw that he was clever despite an entire
indifference to his natural abilities  and the sympathy of her nature
conveyed what she thought 

“oh  i do  now ” he replied with unwonted enthusiasm  “i must say that
the blind rush everybody seems to be in is a trifle disconcerting
at first  it makes an englishman feel  rather  as if his youngest
child  the child of his old age  as it were  was on a dead run  and
that he must rush after to see what it was all about or be left behind
like an old fogey  upon my word i feel fully ten years older than i did
when i landed ”

she laughed so heartily that he felt a sudden desire to say something
really clever  and wondered why he usually took so little trouble 

“that is the very best statement of one of our racial differences i
have heard ” she said  “i shall remember to tell it to my husband  he
will be delighted  i feel the rush myself at times  for i was born in
a far more languid climate  but new york is an electrifying place  it
would fascinate you in time ”

“it fascinates me already!” he said gallantly  “and it is certainly
reposeful here ”

“it is always the same  particularly at five o’clock ” she replied 

“does that mean that i can drop in sometimes at this hour?”

“ will  you?”

“i am afraid i shall be tempted to come every day ”

“that would be our pleasure ” and again she smiled  it was a smile that
had warmed older hearts than the weary young profligate’s  “augusta is
almost invariably here and i usually am  occasionally i drive down to
bring my husband home ”

the duke understood her perfectly  her graceful pleasure in meeting
him was not to be misconstrued  as she turned to greet a new comer he
regarded her closely  if she had not taken the trouble to convey her
subtle warning  he should have guessed that she loved her husband  then
he fell to wondering what sort of a man forbes was to have developed
the abundant harvest of such a woman’s nature  “she could easily have
been made something very different in the wrong hands ” he thought 
“and not in one respect only but in many  what a mess i should have
made of a nature like that! little miss creighton  with her meagre
and neutral make up is about all i am equal to  this woman might have
lifted me up once  but more likely i should have dragged her down  she
is all woman  the kind that is controlled and moulded by the will of a
man ”

his eyes rested on her mouth  “she will hurt forbes some day  give him
a pretty nasty time  but it won’t be because she doesn’t love him 
and  she’ll make him forget  when she gets ready  a man would forgive a
woman like that anything ”

she turned suddenly and met his eyes  “what are you thinking?” she
demanded 

“that mr  forbes must be a remarkable man ” he answered quickly  he
rose  “i must go over and speak to miss forbes  but i shall come back ”

mabel’s eyes were full of coquettish reproach  augusta chaffed him for
forgetting their existence  her manner was not her mother’s  but it was
high bred  and equally sincere  she presented him to the other girls 
and to mrs  burr  who lifted her lorgnette  and regarded him with a
prolonged and somewhat discomforting stare  but it was difficult to
embarrass the duke of bosworth  he went over and sat beside mabel 

“i think i met him once ” said mrs  burr to augusta  “but he is so very
unindividual that i cannot possibly remember ”

“i think he is charming ” said miss forbes  “i had quite a talk with
him last night ”

“he doesn’t look stupid  but he’s not precisely hypnotic ”

“oh  there’s  something  about him!” exclaimed one of the other
girls  “i feel sure that he’s fascinating ”

“he looks as though he knew so much of the world ” said another  with
equal enthusiasm 

“what’s the matter with us?” demanded one of the young men 

“you haven’t a title ” said mrs  burr 

“hal  you are quite too horrid  i have not thought of his title  not
once  but norry  you  can’t  look like that  no matter how hard
you try ”

“oh yes i can  it’s not so hard as you imagine  only it’s not my
chronic effect  when i am  ah  indiscreet enough to produce it  i have
the grace to keep out of sight ”

“that is not what i mean ”

“oh  he is an englishman  with a title ” said the young man  huffily 
“miss maitland  have you caught the fever?”

“i have either had all  or have outgrown the children’s diseases  and
i class the title fever among them  i know that some get it late in
life  but some people will catch anything  our old butler has just had
the mumps ”

“that’s a jolly way of looking at it ”

“oh you men are not altogether exempt ” said mrs  burr  “but the
funniest case is ellis davis  he’s just come back from london with
a wild cockney accent  calls himself ‘daivis ’ and says ‘todai’ and
the princess of ‘wailes ’ and ‘paiper ’ probably he also says ‘caike’
and ‘laidy ’ i can’t think where he got it  for he must have had
 some  letters  and you may bet your prospects he presented them ”

“possibly he saw more of the hotel servants and his barber than he did
of the others ” suggested miss maitland 

“or his ear may be defective  or his memory bad  and he got mixed ”
replied mrs  burr  “we’ll give him the benefit of the doubt  but i
can’t think why the most original people on earth want to imitate
anyone  and yet they say we hate the english  great heaven! why  we
even drink the nasty concoction called english breakfast tea  a brand
the english villagers would not give tuppence a pound for  simply
because it has the magic word tacked on to it ”

“we don’t hate the english ” said augusta  “what nonsense  the irish
do  and the politicians toady to the irish and control certain of the
newspapers  that is all there is in it  but they make the most noise ”

“and  we  grovel ” said mrs  burr  “it is a pity we can’t strike a
happy medium ”

“i think the greater part of the nation is indifferent ” said miss
maitland  “or at all events recognises the bond of blood and gratitude ”

the duke was making his peace with mabel 

“i was afraid i bored you this morning ” he said  “it is good of you
not to tell me that you don’t want to talk to me again for a week ”

“you only stayed an hour  did it seem so long?”

“i never paid a call of twenty minutes before ” he said unblushingly 

“oh  how sweet of you!”

“not at all  can i walk home with you? is that proper?”

“oh  there will be a lot of us together  and they will all want to talk
to you ”

“my valuable conversation shall be devoted to you alone ” he hesitated
a moment  “shall you be at home this evening?”

she looked down  tucking the end of her glove under her cuff  “yes  i
rarely go out two nights in succession ”

“may i call again?”

“yes ”

she looked up and met his eyes  “it has to be done ” thought the
englishman  “there’s no getting out of it now  and i may as well take
the plunge and get over it  and she certainly is likeable ”

“they are going now ” said mabel 

he went over to mrs  forbes to make his adieux 

“i haven’t given you any tea ” she said  “it was stupid of me to forget
it  you must come back to morrow and have a cup ”

“i shall come  for the tea ” he said 

“and you must dine with us? some day next week  thursday?”

“thanks  awfully  i’ll come on any pretence ”

“you must  fletcher  take the duke into the dining room  it is so cold
outside ”

and to this invitation the duke responded with no less grace  then
walked home with mabel and left her at her door  happy and elated 




chapter vii 


mr  forbes stood in his office  his eyes rivetted on a narrow
belt of telegraph ticking which slipped loosely through his hands  yard
after yard  from a machine on the table  as it fell to the floor and
coiled and piled about him  until the upper part of his body alone was
visible  it seemed to typify the rising waters of wall street  outside 
the city was white and radiant  under snow and electric light  in the
comfortable office the curtains were drawn  a gas log flamed in the
grate  and the electric loops were hot 

mr  forbes had stood motionless for an hour  his hat was on the back of
his head  his brow was corrugated  his lips were pressed together  his
eyes like flint  the secretary and clerk had addressed him twice  but
had been given no heed  the hieroglyphics on that strip of white paper
sliding so rapidly through his fingers had his brain in their grip  for
the moment he was a financial machine  nothing more 

suddenly the ticking was softly brushed from his hands  the coils about
him kicked apart by a little foot  and he looked down into the face of
his wife  she was enveloped in sables  her cheeks were brilliant with
the pink of health and cold  mr  forbes’ brow relaxed  he drew a deep
sigh and removed his hat 

“well! i am glad i came for you ” she exclaimed  “i believe you would
have stood there all night  you looked like a statue  is anything
wrong?”

“i have merely stood here and watched a half million drift through my
fingers ” he said  “northern consolidated is dropping like a parachute
that won’t open  but let us go home  i am very glad you came down ”

when they were in the brougham she slipped her hand into his under
cover of the rug  “are you worried?” she asked 

“no  i don’t know that i am  i can hold on  and when this panic is over
the stock will undoubtedly go up again  i have only a million in it 
but i am sorry for creighton  about two thirds of all he’s got are in
this railroad  and i’m afraid he won’t be able to hold on  but let us
drop the subject  the thing has got to rest until to morrow morning 
and i may as well rest  too  besides  nothing weighs very heavily when
i am at home  are we booked for anything to night?”

“there is mary gallatin’s  musicale   she has melba and maurel 
and there is the big dance at the latimer burr’s  but if you are tired
i don’t care a rap about either  augusta can go with harriet ”

“do stay home  that’s a good girl  i am tired  and what is worse  a lot
of men will get me into the smoking room and talk ‘slump ’ if i could
spend the evening lying on the divan in your boudoir  while you read or
played to me  i should feel that life was quite all that it should be ”

“well  you shall  we have so few good times together in winter ”

he pressed her hand gratefully  “tell me ” he said after a moment  “do
you think this socialism mooning of augusta’s means anything?”

“no ” she said contemptuously  “i hope that has not been worrying you 
girls must have their fads  last year it was pink parrots  this year it
is socialism  next year it will be weddings  by the way  what do you
think of the duke?”

“i can’t say i’ve thought about him at all ”

“he is really quite charming ”

“is he? his title is  i suppose you mean  have you seen him since?”

“since when? oh  the night of  don giovanni   i forgot that you
had not been home to tea this week  he has dropped in with fletcher
several times ”

“ah! well  i hope he improves on acquaintance  what does augusta think
of this magnificent specimen of english manhood?”

“i think she rather likes him  she has seen much more of him than i
have  and says that she finds him extremely interesting ”

“ good  god!”

“but he must have something to him  ned dear  for augusta is very
 difficile   i never heard her say that a man was interesting
before ”

“and she has been surrounded by healthy well grown self respecting
americans all her life  the infatuation for titles is a germ disease
with americans  more particularly with new yorkers  the moment the
microbe strikes the blood  inflammation ensues  and the women that get
it don’t care whether the immediate cause is a man or a remnant  is his
engagement to mabel creighton announced?”

“no  she told augusta that he had spoken to her but not to her
father  that mr  creighton was in such a bad humour about something
she thought it best to wait a while  i suppose it is this northern
consolidated business ”

“it certainly is  and if the dukelet is impecunious  i am afraid mabel
won’t get him  for there will be nothing to buy him with  don’t speak
of this  however  creighton may pull through  the stock may take a
sudden jump  or he may have resources of which i know nothing  i
should be the last to hint that he was in a hole  don’t talk any more
here  it strains the voice so ”

they were jolting over the rough stones of fifth avenue  where speech
rasped and wounded the throat  the long picturesque street of varied
architecture throbbed with the life of a winter’s afternoon  the swarm
of carriages on the white highway looked like huge black beetles with
yellow eyes  multiplying without end  the sidewalks were crowded with
opposing tides  girls of the orchid world  brightly dressed  taking
their brisk constitutional  young men  smartly groomed  promenading
with the ponderous tread of fashion  business men  rushing for the
hotels where they could hear the late gossip of wall street  the
rockets of the opera company  splendidly arrayed  and carrying
themselves with a haughty swing which challenged the passing eye  and
the contingent that had come to stare  but snow clouds had brought
an early dusk  and all were moving homeward  by the time the forbes
reached their house in the upper part of the avenue the sidewalks were
almost deserted  and snow stars were whirling 

the halls and dining room of the forbes mansion were hung with
tapestries  all the rooms  though home like  were stately and imposing 
subdued in colour and rich in effect  but if the house had been
designed in the main as a proper setting for a very great lady  one
boudoir and bedroom were the more personal encompassment of a beautiful
and luxurious woman  the walls and windows and doors of the boudoir
were hung with raw silk  opal hued  the furniture was covered with the
same material  on the floor was a white velvet carpet  touched here and
there with pale colour  the opal effect was enhanced by the lamps and
ornaments  which cunningly simulated the gem  in one corner was a small
piano  enamelled white and opalized by the impressionist’s brush 

the pink satin on the walls of the bedroom gleamed through the delicate
mist of lace  a shower of lace half concealed the low upholstered bed 
the deep carpet was pink  the dressing table a huge pink and white
butterfly  with furnishings of pink coral inlaid with gold  a small
alcove was walled with a looking glass  every four years  when mr 
forbes was away at the national convention  his wife refurnished these
rooms  she was a woman of abounding variety and knew its potence 

mr  forbes passed the evening on the divan in the boudoir  while his
wife  attired in a  negligée  of corn coloured silk  her warm 
heavy hair unbound  played chopin with soft  smothered touch for an
hour  then read to him the latest novel  it was one of many evenings 
and when he told her that he was the happiest man alive  she remarked
to herself  “it would be the same  i love him devotedly  nevertheless 
during these next few weeks he shall not be allowed to forget just how
happy i do make him ”




chapter viii 


fletcher cuyler was banging with all his might on the upright
piano in one corner of the parlour of his handsome bachelor apartment 
the door was thrown open and the servant announced in a solemn voice 

“his grace  the duke of bosworth  sir ”

a bald crown and a broad grin appeared for a moment above the top of
the piano 

“sit down  make yourself easy while i finish this  it’s a bravura i’m
composing ” and he returned to the keys 

“i wish you’d stop that infernal racket ” said the duke peevishly 
“it’s enough to tear the nerves out of a man’s body  besides  i want to
talk to you ”

but cuyler played out his bravura to the thundering end  then came
leaping down the room  swinging his long legs in the air as if they
were strung on wires 

the duke was staring into the fire  huddled together  he looked sullen
and miserable 

“hallo!” cried his host  “what’s up? anything wrong?”

“nothing particular  i’ve made an infernal mess of things  that’s all 
i hear on good authority that creighton has never been worth more than
a million or so at any time  and is losing money  and  without conceit 
i believe i could have had miss forbes ”

“conceit? you’d be a geranium coloured donkey if you had the remotest
doubt of the fact  she’s fairly lunged at you  i’ve known augusta
forbes since she was in long clothes  she was called ‘honey’ until
she was ten  if you can believe it  but at that age she insisted upon
augusta or nothing  well  where was i?  i never knew her to come off
her perch before  she always went in more or less for the intellectual 
and of late has been addling her poor little brain with the problems of
the day  well  the end is not yet  have you spoken to mr  creighton?”

“no  i barely have the honour of his acquaintance  upon the rare
occasions when he graces his own table he’s as solemn as a mummy  i’m
willing to admit that i have not yet summoned up courage to ask him for
an interview  he’s polite enough  but he certainly is not encouraging ”

“oh  all the big men are grumpy just now  the richer they are the more
they have to lose  well  whichever way it works out  you have my best
wishes  i’d like to see aire castle restored ”

“i believe in my heart that’s all i’m in this dirty business for  i
don’t enjoy the sensation of the fortune hunter  if i have any strong
interest left in life beyond seeing the old place as it should be i am
not conscious of it ”

“come  come  bertie  brace up  for god’s sake  have a brandy and soda 
you’ll be blowing your brains out the first thing i know  can’t you get
up a little sentiment for mabel creighton? she’s a dear little thing ”

“i loved one woman once  and after she had ruined me  she left me for
another man ” he gave a short laugh  “she didn’t have the decency to
offer to support me  although she was making a good £60 a week  i don’t
appear to be as fortunate as some of my brothers  oh  we are a lovely
lot ” he drank the brandy and soda  and resumed  “i have no love left
in me for any woman  mabel creighton is a girl to be tolerated  that
is all  and more so than miss forbes  nevertheless  i wish i had taken
things more slowly and met the latter before i was committed  you may
as well be killed for a sheep as a lamb  and i am afraid i am not going
to get enough with miss creighton to make it worth while  if he offered
me two hundred thousand pounds  i don’t believe i’d have the assurance
to refuse ”

the servant entered and thrust out a granitic arm  at the end of which
was a wedgewood tray supporting a note 

“from mrs  forbes ” said cuyler  he read the note  “she wants to see me
at once ” he added  “i wonder what’s up  well  i must leave you  go or
stay  just as you like  and good luck to you ”




chapter ix 


the englishman sat tapping the top of his shoe with his stick
for some moments after cuyler had left  then rose abruptly  left the
building  and hailing a hansom  drove down town to mr  creighton’s
office in the equitable building  the elevator shot him up to the fifth
floor  and after losing his way in the vast corridors several times  he
was finally steered to his quarry 

a boy who sat by a table in the private hall way reading the sporting
extra of an evening newspaper  took in his card  mr  creighton saw
him at once  the room into which the duke was shown was large  simply
furnished  and flooded with light  the walls seemed to be all windows 
the roar of broadway came faintly up  a telegraph machine in the corner
ticked intermittently  and slipped forth its coils of clean white
ticking  so flimsy and so portentous  from an inner office came the
sound of a type writer 

mr  creighton rose and shook hands with his visitor  then closed the
door leading into the next room and resumed his seat by a big desk
covered with correspondence  he had a smooth shaven determined face
that had once been very good looking  but there were bags under the
anxious eyes  and his cheeks were haggard and lined 

“he is a man of few words  probably because his wife is a woman of so
many ” thought the duke  “i suppose i shall have to begin ”

he was not a man of many words himself 

“i have come down here ” he said  “because it seems impossible to find
you at your house  and it is necessary that i should speak to you on a
matter that concerns us both  i came to america to ask your daughter to
marry me ”

“have you done so?”

“i have ”

“has she accepted you?”

“of course she wishes to refer the matter to you ”

“she wishes to marry you?”

“i think she does ”

mr  creighton sighed heavily  he wheeled about and looked through the
window 

“i wish she could ” he said   “if she loves you  i don’t know you  i
haven’t had time to think about you  i should prefer that she married
an american  myself  but i should never have crossed her so long as
she chose a gentleman and a man of honour  i know nothing of your
record  were the marriage possible  i should enquire into it  but i
am afraid that it is not  i am well aware  pardon my abruptness  that
no englishman of your rank comes to america for a wife if his income
is sufficient to enable him to marry in his own country ” he paused
a moment  then he resumed  the effort was apparent  “i must ask your
confidence for a time  but it is necessary to tell you that i am
seriously involved  in short  if things don’t mend  and quickly  i
shall go to pieces ”

the duke was sitting forward  staring at the carpet  his chin pressed
hard upon the head of his stick  “i am sorry ” he said  “very sorry ”

“so am i  mabel has two hundred thousand dollars of her own  i have as
much more  something over  in land that is as yet unmortgaged  but
that is not the amount you came for ”

the duke of bosworth was traversing the most uncomfortable moments of
his life  he opened his mouth twice to speak before he could frame a
reply that should not insult his host and show himself the exponent of
a type for which he suddenly experienced a profound disgust 

“aire castle ” he said finally  “is half a ruin  all the land i have
inherited which is not entailed is mortgaged to the hilt  i may add
that i also inherited about half of the mortgages  my income is a
pittance  it would cost two hundred thousand pounds to repair the
castle  and until it is repaired  i have no home to offer a wife  in
common justice to a woman  i must look out that she brings money with
her  that is my position  it is a nasty one  it is good of you not to
call me a fortune hunter and order me out ”

“well  well  at least you have not intimated that you are conferring an
inestimable honour in asking me to regild your coronet  i appreciate
your position  it is ugly  so is mine  thank you for being frank ”

the englishman rose  he held out his hand  “i hope you’ll come out all
right ” he said  with a sudden and rare burst of warmth  “i do indeed 
good luck to you ”

mr  creighton shook his hand heartily  “thank you  i won’t  but i’m
glad you feel that way ”

he went with his guest to the outer door  the boy had disappeared  mr 
creighton opened the door  the duke was about to pass out  he turned
back  hesitated a moment  “i shall go up and see your daughter at
once ” he said  “have i your permission to tell her what  what  you
have told me?”

“yes ” said mr  creighton  “she must know sooner or later ”




chapter x 


the duke did not call a hansom when he reached the street  the
interview to come was several times more trying to face than the last
had been  he preferred to walk the miles between the equitable building
and murray hill 

he reached the house in an hour  miss creighton was in the library
reading a novel by the fire  and looked up brightly as he entered 

“you are a very bad man ” she said  “i have waited in for you all day 
and it is now half past four  i am reading kenilworth  the love scenes
are too funny for words  amy hangs upon leicester’s neck and exclaims
‘my noble earl!’ fancy if i called you ‘my noble duke ’ how perfectly
funny!”

the duke took his stand on the hearth rug  man’s immemorial citadel of
defence  and tapped his chin with his hat  regarding mabel stolidly
with his fishy pale blue gaze  he was cross and uncomfortable and hated
himself  but his face expressed nothing 

“i have seen your father ” he said 

“oh  have you? what  what did he say?”

“when i asked you to marry me i explained how i was situated ”

“i know  won’t papa?  he’s very generous ”

“he can’t  he is very seriously embarrassed ”

the girl’s breath shortened painfully  she turned very white 
unconsciously she twisted her hands together 

“then we cannot marry?”

“how can we? do you want to spend your life hounded by lawyers 
money lenders  and financial syndicates  and unable to keep up your
position? you would die of misery  poor child  i am not a man to make a
woman happy on three hundred thousand pounds a year  poor! it would be
hell ”

she did not look up  but sat twirling her rings 

“you know best ” she said  “i don’t know the conditions of life in
england  if you say that we should be miserable  you must know  i
suppose you did not love me very much ”

“not much  mabel  i have only the skeleton of a heart in me  i wonder
it does duty at all  you are well rid of me ”

“you certainly did not make any very violent protestations  i cannot
accuse you of hypocrisy ”

“one thing  i was not half good enough for you  as far as i can
remember this is the first time i have ever humbled myself  you are a
jolly little thing and deserve better luck ”

she made no reply 

“i shall cross almost immediately  shall give it out that you have
refused me ”

“you need not  i have told no one but augusta  people will think
that we are merely good friends  we will treat each other in a frank
off hand manner when we meet out ”

“you are a game little thing! you’d make a good wife  a good fellow to
chum with  i wish it could have come round our way ”

he was quick of instinct  and divined that she wanted to be alone 

“ au revoir  ” he said  “we meet to night at dinner  somewhere 
don’t we?”

“at the burr’s ” she rose and held out her hand  she was very pale 
but quite composed  and her flower like face had the dignity which
self respect so swiftly conceives and delivers  he had never been so
near to loving her  she had bored him a good deal during the past
weeks  but he suddenly saw possibilities in her  they were not great 
but they would have meant something to him  he wanted to kiss her  but
raised her hand to his lips instead  and went out 

mabel waited until she heard the front door close  then ran up to her
room and locked herself in 

“i mustn’t cry ” was her only thought for the moment 

“i mustn’t  mustn’t! my eyes are always swollen for four hours and my
nose gets such a funny pink  i remember augusta once quoted some poetry
about it  i forget it ”

she looked at the divan  it exerted a powerful magnetism  she saw
herself lying face downward  sobbing  she caught hold of a chair to
hold herself back  “i can’t!” she thought  “i can’t! i must brace up
for that dinner  the girls must never know  oh! i wish i were dead! i
wish i were dead!”

“i wish i were dead!” she said it aloud several times  thinking it
might lighten the weight in her breast  but it did not  she looked at
the clock and shuddered  “it is only five  what am i to do until lena
comes to dress me? she won’t come until half past six  i can’t go to
mamma  she would drive me distracted  oh! i think i am going mad  but i
 won’t  make a fool of myself ”

she walked up and down the room  clenching her hands until the nails
bit the soft palms  “i read somewhere ” she continued aloud  “that
the clever people suffered most  that their nerves are more developed
or something  i wonder what that must be like  poor things! i am not
clever  and i feel as if i’d dig my grave with my own fingers if i
could get into it  oh! am i going to cry? i won’t  i’ll think about
something that will make me angry  augusta  she’ll get him now  she’s
wanted him from the first  i’ve seen it  she was honourable enough not
to regularly try to cut me out  but there’s nothing in the way now  and
she will  i know she will  i hate her  i hate her  oh  god!  what 
shall i do?”

she heard the front door open  a moment later her father ascend the
stair and enter his room  she ran across the hall  opened his door
without ceremony and caught him about the neck  but still without tears 

he set his lips and held her close  then he kissed and fondled her
as he had not done for years  “poor little girl ” he said  “i am a
terrible failure  god knows i should have been glad to have bought your
happiness for you  as it is  i am afraid i have ruined it ”

she noticed for the first time how worn and old he looked  her
development had been rapid during the last hour  she passed on to a new
phase  “poor papa ” she said  putting her hands about his face  “it
must be awful for you  and you have never told us  listen   he 
said i would make a plucky wife  a good fellow  i’ll take care of you
and brace you up  i’ll be everything to you  papa  indeed i will  papa 
you are not crying! don’t! i have to go out to dinner to night! listen 
i don’t care much  indeed i don’t  i’m sure i often wondered why he
attracted me so much when i thought him over  alex says that if he were
an american she wouldn’t take the trouble to reform him  that he isn’t
worth it  and hal says he looks like a dough pudding  half baked  it’s
dreadful that we can’t control our feelings better  papa  give me every
spare moment you can  won’t you? i can’t stand the thought of the
girls ”

“yes ” he said  “every minute  and as soon as i can we’ll go off
somewhere together  it would be a great holiday for me  it is terrible
for me to see you suffer  but i am selfish enough to be glad that i
shall not lose you  stay with me awhile  this will pass  you can’t
believe that now  but it will  and the next time you love  the man will
be more worthy of you  i don’t want to hurt you  my darling  but for
the life of me  i can’t think what you see in him ”

that evening  shortly after miss forbes had been dressed for
mrs  burr’s dinner  her mother entered and dismissed the maid 

“what is it  mamma?” augusta demanded in some surprise  “how odd you
look  not as pretty as usual ”

mrs  forbes’ lips had withdrawn from their pout  her whole face had
lost its sensuousness and seemed to have settled into rigid lines  she
went over to the fire and lifted one foot to the fender  then turned
and looked at her daughter 

“do you wish to marry the duke of bosworth?” she asked abruptly 

a wave of red rose slowly to augusta’s hair  her lips parted  “what do
you mean?” she enquired after a moment  her voice was a little thick 
“he is engaged to mabel ”

“he cannot marry mabel  mr  creighton is on the verge of ruin ”

miss forbes gasped  “oh  how dreadful!” she exclaimed  but something
seemed to suffuse her brain with light 

“you can marry him if you wish ”

“but mabel is my most intimate friend  it would be like outbidding her 
she has the two hundred thousand dollars that her grandmother left her 
and her father could surely give her as much more ”

“what would four hundred thousand dollars be to a ruined duke  up to
his ears in debt? he wants millions ”

“but papa does not like him ”

“leave your father to me  and be guided entirely by me in this matter 
i have a plan mapped out if he will not give his consent at once  do
you wish to marry this man?”

miss forbes drew a hard breath  “i want to marry him more than anything
in the world ” she said 




chapter xii 


about the same time  as the duke of bosworth was dressing for
dinner in his rooms at the waldorf  he received the following note   

  “duky  duky  daddledums!  i have great news for you  rush
  your engagements  and come here between twelve and one to night 

                                             f  c ”

as the young englishman entered cuyler’s rooms a little after midnight 
he received such warmth of greeting from a powerful hand concealed
behind the  portière  that his backbone doubled 

“for god’s sake  fletcher ” he said crossly  “remember that i am not a
hercules  what do you want of me?”

“sit down  sit down  i’ll put you in a good humour if i have to break a
bank  i’ve pledged it to my peace of mind  well  first  creighton has
practically gone to smash ”

“i know it  he told me so this afternoon  poor man  i felt sorry for
him  and i think he did for me  although his respect may have been
something less than his pity  i know i felt uncommonly cheap  and if he
had kicked me out i doubt if i should have resented it  he said that
what with his daughter’s fortune and some land investments  he might
scrape together a hundred thousand pounds  i told him it wouldn’t pay
my debts  then i had an interview with her  don’t ask me to repeat it 
good god  what have we come to? drop the subject ”

“i haven’t begun yet  my conscience wouldn’t rest  however  unless i
paused to remark that i am deuced sorry for the creightons  they are
the best sort  and i hate to see them go under  well  to proceed  you
can have miss forbes ”

the nobleman’s dull eyes opened  “what do you mean?”

“i had an interview of a purely diplomatic nature with  la belle
mère  after i left you  she is willing  miss forbes is willing 
nay  willing is not the word  i named your price  the modest sum of
$5 000 000  she said you should have it ”

“but mr  forbes despises me  by heaven  i have more respect for that
man than for anybody i have met in america  every time i meet those
steel eyes of his i seem to read  ‘you poor  miserable  little wretch
of a fortune hunter! go home and blow out your brains  but don’t
disgrace your name by bartering it for our screaming eagles ’ he’ll
never consent ”

“my boy  you need a b  and s  do brace up ” fletcher wagged his head
pathetically  “you’ll have me crying in a minute  i’ve been on the
verge of tears for the last three weeks  now let me tell you that you
are all right  there may be a tussle  but forbes is bound to cave in
the end  he is infatuated with his wife and she knows her power  she
is as set on this match as you could be  she’s had the bee in her
bonnet for a good many years  to cut as great a dash in london as she
does in new york  of course she’s in it in a way when she’s over there
for a month or two during the season  but she wants a long sight more
than that  her ancestry does her no good because the english trunk
of the family died out two hundred years ago  as your mother in law
she’d be out of sight  a woman with her beauty and brain and style
and charm could bring any society in the world to her feet  and keep
it there once she had those feet planted beyond the door mat  now she
is patronised pleasantly as one of many pretty american women who flit
back and forth  you’ve got a powerful ally  and one that’s bound to
win  now pull up that long face or i’ll hold you under the cold water
spout!”

“i believe you have put new life into me ” said his grace  the duke of
bosworth 




chapter xiii 


augusta was moving restlessly about her boudoir  her mind was
uneasy and a trifle harrowed  for the first time in her life she was
not thoroughly satisfied with herself  once she sat down and opened
“progress and poverty”  but george had ceased to charm  and she resumed
her restless marching  her boudoir was a scarlet confusion of silk and
crêpe  and conducive to cheerfulness  although it extinguished her drab
colouring  augusta usually felt her best in its glow and warmth  but
to day she felt her worst 

suddenly she paused  there was a sound of rapid ascent of stair and
familiar voices  she opened her door  and a moment later mrs  burr
and miss maitland entered  both looked unusually grave  and slightly
pugnacious  augusta experienced a disagreeable sensation in her knees 

“has anything happened?” she asked  after she had greeted them and they
were seated 

“augusta!” said miss maitland sternly  “we are perhaps meddling in
what is none of our affair  nevertheless  we have made up our minds to
speak ”

“well?”

“are you trying to get the duke of bosworth away from mabel creighton?”

“i am not ”

“it looks like it ”

“does it?”

“you are keeping something back  augusta ” said mrs  burr  “out with
it ”

miss forbes recovered herself  “i am going to marry the duke of
bosworth ” she said distinctly 

“augusta forbes!”

“yes  and i have not cut out mabel creighton  i am perfectly willing
to justify myself to you  as we have always kept to our compact to
stand the truth from each other  he came over here to marry mabel  but
mr  creighton could not give him the portion  dot  you know  he is
dreadfully embarrassed   but that is a dead secret  ”

“and you have out bid her?”

“i have done nothing of the sort  the thing was quite settled before
the duke spoke to me ”

“he didn’t lose much time  he must have been pretty sure how he would
be received before he wound up with mabel ”

“i did not discuss that part of it with him ”

“it’s too bad you didn’t discuss less  poor mabel is a wreck  the way
she is trying to keep up is positively pathetic ”

“well  my not marrying him would not help her ”

“augusta  you are wood all through ”

the young matron threw herself back in her chair  and beat her knuckles
sharply with her lorgnette  miss maitland  who had not spoken for some
moments  now unburdened herself 

“i have a good deal to say  augusta  and i am going to say it  you know
we all agreed before we came out that we would regard certain matters
in a different light from that of most fashionable girls  we agreed 
among other things  that  while enjoying all that our wealth and
position offered us  we would read  and think  and endeavour to be of
some use in the world  not write polemical novels  or belong to clubs 
or anything of that sort  but take the very best advantages of the
accident of our birth  and we also agreed  do you remember?  that we
would cultivate higher ideals than most women care for  particularly
in our relations to each other and to men  it is three years since that
subject was discussed  but you remember it  i suppose ”

“i do  and i have not broken it ”

“very well  i shall say no more about that particular phase of the
matter  that is for you to settle with your own conscience  and with
mabel  this is what we are chiefly concerned with  there are several
ways by which our example can benefit society  and the chief of them is
to stop marrying impecunious foreign nobles!”

she paused a moment  augusta stiffened up  but made no reply  miss
maitland resumed 

“as long as we continue to jump at titles whenever they come
gold hunting and jew flying  just so long shall we  the upper class
of the united states  which should be its best  be contemptible in
the eyes of the world  just so long shall we be sneered at in the
newspapers  lampooned in novels  excoriated by serious outsiders  and
occupy an entirely false place in contemporary history  we are so
conspicuous  that everything we do is tittle tattled in the press  we
are such a god send to them that it is a thousand pities we don’t give
them something worth writing about  now  my idea is this  that all
we new york girls band together and vow not to marry any foreigner
of title  english or otherwise  unless he can cap our prospective
inheritance by twice the amount  which is equivalent to vowing that we
will go untitled to our graves  also  that such girls as we fail to
convert from this nonsensical snobbery  and who insist upon marrying
titles whenever they can get them  will see none of us at their
weddings 

“now this is the point  that would not only express to the whole world
our contempt for the alliance of the fortune hunter and the snob  but
it would raise the self esteem of our own men  and be one step toward
making them better than they are  you couldn’t convince one of them
that we are not all watching the foreign horizon with spy glasses 
waiting to make a break for the first title that appears  and that they
have not got to be content with the leavings  but if they saw that we
really desired to marry americans  and  above all  men that we could
love and respect  i believe they would make an effort to be worthy of
us  that would certainly be one great step gained  the next thing for
us to do is to be able to love hard enough to awaken the right kind of
love in men ”

“well?” asked augusta 

miss maitland’s cheeks were flushed  she looked almost beautiful 
augusta felt that she looked pasty  but did not care  she was angry 
but determined to control herself 

“you have a great opportunity  dismiss the duke of bosworth  and avow
openly that you will only marry an american  that the american at his
best is your ideal  how it can be otherwise  as the daughter of your
father  passes my comprehension  will you?”

“bravo  alexis!” said mrs  burr  “we’ll have to find a man who’s
hunting for an ideal woman  and you didn’t mention socialism once ”

“that belongs to the future  i have come to the conclusion that we must
build the house before we can fresco the walls ”

augusta had risen  and was walking up and down the room  at the end of
three or four minutes she paused and faced her visitors  looking down
upon them with her habitual calm  slightly accentuated 

“a month ago i should have agreed with you ” she said  “your ideas 
alex  are always splendid  and  usually  no one is more willing to
adopt them than i  but theories sometimes collide with facts  i am
going to marry the duke of bosworth ”

they rose 

“i hope you’ll scratch each other’s eyes out!” said mrs  burr 

“you married for money ” retorted augusta 

“i did  and my reasons were good ones  as you know  moreover  i married
a man  and an american  if i hadn’t liked him  and if he’d looked as
if he’d been boiled for soup  i wouldn’t have looked at him if he’d
owned colorado  latimer’s wings are not sprouting  and he doesn’t take
kindly to the idea of being reformed  but i don’t regret having married
him  not for a minute  you will  maybe you won’t though ”

miss maitland had fastened her coat  she gave her muff a little shake 

“good bye  augusta ” she said icily  “it is too bad that you inherited
nothing from your father but his iron will ”

and without shaking hands they went out 




chapter xiv 


but although augusta had maintained an attitude of stiff
defiance  she was by no means pleased with herself  she rang for her
maid  dressed for the street  and a few moments later was on her way
to murray hill  when she reached the creighton’s she went directly
up to mabel’s room  and  after a hasty tap  entered  mabel was lying
full length on the divan among her rainbow pillows  a silver bottle of
smelling salts at her nose 

she rose at once 

“i have a headache ” she said coldly  “sit down ”

“mabel!” said augusta precipitately  “should you think me dishonourable
if i married the duke of bosworth?”

“if i did would it make any difference?”

“no  but i’d rather you didn’t ”

mabel turned her head away and looked into the logs burning on the
hearth 

“until you yourself told me that it was over ” pursued augusta  “i gave
him no sort of encouragement  but as you cannot marry him yourself  i
don’t see why i shouldn’t ”

“no  i suppose there is no reason why you shouldn’t  only it is
something i couldn’t do myself ”

“you don’t know whether you could or not  nobody knows what abstract
sentiments he’ll sacrifice when he wants a thing badly  if somebody
suddenly died and left you a fortune  wouldn’t you take him from me if
you could?”

“yes  i would ”

“well  that would be much more dishonourable than anything i have
done ”

“i suppose so  i don’t care  i don’t call that kind of thing honour  i
wouldn’t have done it in the first place ”

“i fail to see any distinction  mabel  you never had any reasoning
faculty  i am much more suited to the duke  anyhow  for he is really
clever ”

“it isn’t cleverness he’s after ”

“oh  of course he must have money  one is used to that  it’s like
knowing that lots of people come to your house because you give good
dinners  but you don’t like them any the less  in fact  don’t think
about it  we have to take the world as we find it  if you regard the
duke as a fortune hunter i wonder you can still love him ”

mabel turned her head and regarded miss forbes with a haughty stare 
“i do not love him ” she said  “i despise him too thoroughly  it is my
pride only that is irritated  don’t let there be any doubt on that
point ”

“well  i am delighted  relieved! it has worried me  made me genuinely
unhappy  it has indeed  mabel dear  i will admit that i had misgivings 
that i was not altogether satisfied with myself  but now i can be as
happy as ever again  and you don’t think it dishonourable? please say
that ”

“no  i don’t think it dishonourable  (for we are no longer friends) ”
she added to herself  but she was too generous to say it aloud 

augusta went away a few minutes later  and mabel  who was not going out
that evening  flung herself on the divan  and sobbed into her cushions 




chapter xv 


several evenings later  a banquet was given to a party of
russian notables  as no young people were invited  augusta  chaperoned
by her father’s sister  mrs  van rhuys  arranged a theatre party  which
included the english duke 

as mrs  forbes stood between her mirrors that evening  she wondered if
she had ever looked more lovely  she wore a gown of ivory white satin 
so thick that it creaked  and entirely without trimming  save for the
lace on the bust  but about the waist  one end hanging almost to the
hem of the gown was a ribbon of large pigeon blood rubies  a collar
of the same gems lay at the base of her long round throat  above her
brow blazed a great star  the points set with diamonds  radiating from
a massive ruby  a smaller star clasped the lace at her breast  the
bracelets on her arms  the rings on her fingers  sparkled pink and
white 

her lips parted slightly  she thrilled with triumph  intoxicated
with her beauty and magnificence  for this woman could never become
 blasé   never cease to be vital  until the shroud claimed her 

nevertheless  she felt unaccountably nervous  she had felt so all day 

“i am quite well  am i not  mammy?” she said to an old negro woman who
sat regarding her with rapt admiration  the negress had been virginia’s
nurse and personal attendant for thirty nine years  only the ocean  for
which she had an unsurmountable horror  had separated them  in augusta
she had never taken the slightest interest  but over her idolized
mistress she exercised an austere vigilance  and as she was a good
old fashioned doctor  and understood mrs  forbes’ constitution as had
it been a diagram of straight lines  she was always on the alert to
checkmate nature  and rarely unsuccessful 

“you sut’n’y is  honey ” she replied  “you never was pearter  no wonder
you git ’cited sometimes with all dose purty things that cos’ such
heaps and heaps o’ money  yo’ uster go wild over yore toys  and you
al’ays will be de same ”

it was not yet eight and mrs  forbes seated herself lightly on the old
woman’s knee  at that moment augusta entered the room 

“mother!” she exclaimed in a disgusted voice  “do get up  i declare you
are nothing but a big overgrown baby  if it isn’t papa it’s mammy  and
if it isn’t mammy it’s papa ”

“i suppose you can get through life without coddling ” replied her
mother  undisturbed  “but i can’t  you look remarkably well this
evening ”

“thanks ” miss forbes regarded herself complacently in the mirror  she
wore black and pink and there was colour in her face  “i’m no beauty 
but i think i do look rather well  and this frock is certainly a
stunning fit  you are a vision as usual  there is the carriage ”

mrs  forbes rose and the maid enveloped her in a long mantle of white
velvet lined with ermine  the old negress adjusted the inner flap over
the chest and wrapped a lace scarf about the softly dressed hair 

“you is a leetle nervous  honey ” she said  “has anything put yo’ out?
don’t you tetch one bit o’ sweets to night and not a drap o’ coffee ”

“i’ll have it out when we come home  and get it over ” thought mrs 
forbes as she went down the stair and smiled to her husband  who
awaited her in the hall below  “that is what is making me so nervous ”

mr  forbes  like many new york millionaires  had spread his house
over all the land he could buy in one spot on the avenue  and there
was no  porte cochère   when his wife was obliged to go out in
stormy weather an awning was erected between the front doors and the
curb stone  to night it was snowing heavily  as she appeared on the
stair two men servants opened the doors and flung a carpet from the
threshold to the carriage step  if virginia forbes had ever wet her
boots or slippers she could not recall the occasion 

she was the sensation of the dinner and of the reception afterward 
the foreigners stood about her in a rivetted cluster  and with the
extravagance of their kind assured her that there was no woman in
europe at once so beautiful and so clever  she took their flatteries
for what they were worth  they could have salaamed before her without
turning her head  but she revelled in the adulation  nevertheless 

mr  forbes had two important letters to write when they returned home 
and she went with him to the library  as he took the chair before his
desk she got him a fresh pen  then poured him some whisky from the
decanter  she was as fresh as when she had left the house  and he
looked at her with passionate admiration 

“i should like to be able to tell you how proud i was of you to night ”
he said  “sometimes i believe that you are really the most splendid
creature on earth ”

“that is what those princelings were telling me ” she said  rumpling
his hair  “but you flatter me much more  for i may suspect that you
mean it ”

“well  sit where i can’t see you or i sha’n’t do much writing  don’t
go  though ”

she took an easy chair by the fire  but although she lay in its depths
and put her little feet on a low pouf  she drew the long rope of jewels
nervously through her fingers  once or twice her breath came short  and
then she clasped the rubies so closely that the setting dented her skin 

“i must  must brace up ” she thought  “unless i am at my best i shall
be no match for him  and i must win in the first round or it will be a
long hard fight that i may not be equal to  besides  i should hate it ”

she was glad to have the interview in the library  her husband’s
favourite room  it was a long narrow room  lined to the ceiling with
the books of seven generations  mr  forbes came of a line of men that
had been noted for mental activity in one wise or another since england
had civilized america  there were busts and bas reliefs of great men 
and many pieces of old carved furniture  the curtains  carpet  and easy
chairs were lit with red  and very luxurious  the mantel was of black
onyx  above it was a portrait of mrs  forbes by sargeant  the great
artist protested that he had interpreted “the very sky and sea line of
her soul ” certain it is that he had chosen to see only that which was
noble and alluring  imperious pride was in the poise of the head  the
curve of the short upper lip  but it was the unself conscious pride of
race and the  autorité  of a lovely woman which all men delighted
to foster  the eyes  sensuous  tender  expectant  were the eyes of a
woman who had loved one man only  and that man with fond reiteration 
the lower lip was full  the mouth slightly parted  the brow was so
clear that it seemed to shed radiance  it uplifted the face  as if the
soul dwelt there  at home with the vigorous brain 

some thin white stuff was folded closely over the small low bust  a
string of large pearls was wound in and out of the heavy hair  whose
living warmth the artist had not failed to transfer  indeed  warmth 
life  passion  soul  intelligence seemed to emanate from this wonderful
portrait  so combined by the limner as to convey an impression of
modern womanhood perfected  satisfied  triumphant  to which the world
could give no more  and from which the passing years would hesitate to
steal aught  sometimes virginia forbes stood and regarded it sadly  “it
is an ideal me ” she would think  “all that i should like to be  that
i might  were it not for this trowelful of clay in my soul ” although
mr  forbes was too keen a student of human nature to be ignorant of his
wife’s faults  his faith was so strong in the large full side of her
nature that he had long since felt justified in closing his eyes to
all that fell below the ideal 

he wrote for an hour  then threw the pen down  rose  and ran his
fingers through his hair 

“thank heaven that is over  i can sleep in peace  how good of you to
wait for me  are you very tired?”

“no ” she said  and unconsciously her lips lost their fulness  and she
clutched the stones so tightly that they bruised her flesh  “will you
sit down  ned  dear? i want to talk to you ”

“is anything the matter?” he asked anxiously  “you’ve lost your colour
since you came in  i am afraid you go too hard  new york is a killing
place  shall we go to asheville for a week or two?”

“i never felt better  sit down  there  where i can see you  and light a
cigar  i am going to speak of something very important  you won’t like
what i say  at first  but i am sure you will when i have finished ”

he sat down  much puzzled  “i don’t want to smoke  and i’m afraid
something has gone wrong with you  have you been investing and lost?
you know that i never ask what you do with your money  and if you are
short all you have to do is to ask for more ”

“you know that i never would invest money without your advice  and i
have scarcely touched this year’s income  it is about augusta ”

mr  forbes raised his brows  “augusta? she doesn’t want to take to the
public platform  i hope ”

“she is in love ”

“what? our calm  superior  with whom  for heaven’s sake?”

“with the duke of bosworth ”

mr  forbes sat forward in his chair  pressing his hands upon its arms 
the blood rose slowly and covered his face  “the duke of bosworth!” he
ejaculated  “do you mean to tell me that our daughter  and a girl who
is american to her finger tips  has had her head turned by a title?”

“it is not the title  ned  it is the man    ”

“impossible! the man? why  he’s not a man  he’s  but i don’t choose to
express to you or to any woman what i think of him  i never set up to
be a saint  i went the pace with other men before i married you  but
in my opinion the best thing that remnants like bosworth can do is to
get into the family vault as quickly as possible and leave no second
edition behind them  he’ll leave none of my blood ”

“you misjudge him  dear  i am sure you do  i have talked much with him 
he is very intelligent  and  i think  would be glad to live his life
over  it is his delicate physique that gives him the appearance of a
wreck ”

“excuse me  i have seen men of delicate physique all my life  i am also
a man of the world  sooner than have that puny demoralised creature
the father of my grandchildren  i should gladly see augusta spend her
life alone  happy as we have been  i cannot understand it  she must be
hypnotised  and you  virginia! i am ashamed of you  i cannot believe
that you have encouraged her  you  the cleverest and most sensible
woman i have ever known! do you wish to see your daughter the wife of
that man?”

“i should not if she were like some girls  but she has little sentiment
and ideality  she is a strong masculine character  just the type to
give new life and stamina to the decaying houses of the old world 
she is not as clever as she thinks  but at thirty she will know her
limitations and be a very level headed well balanced woman  she will
shed no tears over the duke’s defections  and you know what darwin says
about the children of strong mothers and dissipated eldest sons  i am
sure that augusta’s children will not disgrace you ”

“what you say sounds well  i never yet knew you to fail to make out a
good case when driven to a corner  but this miserable man’s children
will not be my grandchildren ”

“ned  you are so prejudiced  you are such a rampant american ”

“i am  i hope  and you know perfectly well that i am not prejudiced 
i know many members of the british peerage for whom i have hearty
liking and respect  some of the best brains the world has ever known
have belonged to the english aristocracy  but this whelp  if he were
the son of as good an american as i am do you think it would make
any difference? and if he were worthy of his blood he could have my
daughter and welcome ”

mrs  forbes had controlled herself inflexibly  but she was conscious
of increasing excitement  her eyes looked as hard and brilliant as the
jewels upon her  her hands trembled as she played with her rope of
rubies  she recognised that he was conclusive  that it would be worse
than folly to resort to endearment and cajolery  even could she bring
herself to the mood  but before such uncompromising opposition her
ambition cemented and controlled her  was near to torching reason and
judgment  she would not trust herself to speak for a moment  but looked
fixedly at her husband 

“i thought this little fortune hunter was engaged to mabel creighton ”
he said abruptly 

“that was all a mistake    ”

“he found out that creighton was in a hole  i suppose  virginia!  it
is not possible?  you did not tell him?  you have not been scheming to
bring about this damnable transaction?”

“of course i did not tell him  i wish you wouldn’t screw up your eyes
like that at me  i saw before he had been here a week that he had
fallen in love with augusta    ”

“love be damned! do you imagine a man like that loves?”

“well  liked then  of course he cannot afford to marry without
money    ”

“and i am expected to buy him  i suppose?”

“don’t be so coarse! now listen to me  ned   i  want this
match  of course i should not move in the matter if i did not respect
the duke  and if augusta didn’t love him as much as she is capable
of loving  but i want this english alliance  and there may never be
another opportunity  i will state the fact plainly  it would give me
the greatest possible satisfaction to know that my position was as
assured in england as it is in america    ”

“good god! what is the matter with you american women? if you sat down
and worked it out  could you tell why you are all so mad about the
english nobility? or wouldn’t you blush if you could? as i said the
other day it is a germ disease  a species of brain poisoning  it eats
and rots  it demoralises like morphine and alcohol  after a woman has
once let herself go  she is good for nothing else for the rest of her
life  she eats  drinks  sleeps  thinks english aristocracy  even you 
if i gave you your head  would find it in you to become a veritable
coronet chaser  you!  my god! well  it won’t be in my time  and if
augusta runs off with this debased dishonoured little wretch she’ll
not get one cent of mine  and there will be no breaking of wills  i’ll
dispose of my fortune before i die  i shall take good care to let him
know this at once  for i make no doubt he’s desperate    ”

mrs  forbes sprang to her feet  “you never spoke so to me before ” she
cried furiously  “i do not believe you love me  so long as i spend
my life studying your wishes  and i have studied them for twenty two
years  you are amiable and charming enough  but now that your wife and
daughter want something that you don’t wish to give them  that doesn’t
happen to suit your fancy  you turn upon me in your true character of
a tyrant    ”

“virginia! hush!” said mr  forbes sternly  “i have done nothing of the
sort  you are talking like a petulant child  come here and tell me that
you will think no more of this wretched business    ”

he went forward  but she moved rapidly aside 

“don’t touch me ” she said  “i am not in the mood to be touched  and i
shall never be happy again if you refuse your consent to this marriage ”

“never be what? has our happiness rested on so uncertain a foundation
as that? i thought that you loved me ”

“oh  i do  of course i do  but can’t you understand that love isn’t
everything to a woman?  any more than it is to a man? i would be
married to no other man on earth  not to a prince of the blood  but it
is not everything to me any more than it is everything to you  suppose
you were suddenly stripped of your tremendous political influence 
of your financial power  and reduced to the mere domestic and social
round? would i suffice? not unless you were eighty and in need of a
nurse ”

she had drawn herself up to her full commanding height  her head was
thrown back  her nostrils were distended  her lips were a scarlet
undulating line  there was no other colour in her face  it looked as
opaque  as hard as ivory  the eyes were merciless  even their brown
had lost its warmth  the jewels with which she was hung  which glowed
with deep rubescent fire on her robe and neck and brow  gave her the
appearance of an idol  an idol which had suddenly been informed with
the spirit of pitiless ambition and spurned its creator 

mr  forbes had turned very grey  his nostrils and lips contracted  his
teeth set  involuntarily he glanced from the woman to the portrait  the
portrait was more alive than the woman 

“don’t you understand?” she demanded 

“no ” he said  “i don’t think i do  at least i hope i do not  at all
events  i hope we may not discuss this subject again  i did not tell
you that i intend to pull creighton through  i cannot see an old friend
go under  it will be to the duke’s interest to push his suit in that
quarter  if they want him  now  please go to your room  you are very
much excited  if you were not i hardly think you would have spoken as
you have ”

he went to the end of the room and opened the door  she passed him
quickly with averted head 




chapter xvi 


once more father and daughter faced each other across the
breakfast table  this time  augusta  with a very red face  stared
defiantly into bitter and contemptuous eyes 

“and your socialism? do you expect to convert your duke?”

“no  papa  of course not ”

“it is exactly five weeks since you informed me that you wished me to
devote my fortune to the dear people ”

“i know it  papa  one looks at things very differently when one looks
at them through a man’s eyes  as it were  i mean through the eyes of
the man one has fallen in love with  of course i always have had the
highest respect for your opinion  now  it seems to me a grand thing to
restore the fortunes of an ancient and illustrious house    ”

“that is the reason the good god permitted me to be born  i suppose  to
sacrifice some ten or fifteen years of man’s allotted span in
accumulating millions with which to prop up a rotten aristocracy ”

“papa! i never knew you to be so bitter  you are quite unlike yourself
this morning  of course  we don’t all look at things in the same way in
this world  but i don’t wish you to think that i have entirely forsaken
my old principles  i should do much good with my money in england  the
poverty is said to be frightful there  and i hear that the working men
on the great estates only get a pound a week  and sometimes less  i
should pay those on our estates more  my self ”

“it doesn’t occur to you  i suppose  that american made millions
should be spent in america  and that we have poverty enough of our own ”

“our poor are mostly europeans ” she retorted quickly 

he gave a brief laugh  “you have me there  well  go on  you intend to
reform this poor little trembling sore eyed weak kneed  debauchee    ”

“father! i will not permit you to speak in that way of the duke of
bosworth ”

she had sprung from her chair  like all phlegmatic natures  when the
depths were stirred she was violent and ugly  she looked as if about to
leap upon her parent and beat him 

he rose also and looked down on her  “you will not do what?” he said
with a cutting contempt  “go upstairs to your room  and stay there
until i give you permission to leave it  and understand here  once for
all  that not one dollar of mine will ever go into that man’s pocket 
if he marries you  he will have to support you  or you him  i shall not
take the trouble to enquire which ”




chapter xvii 


mr  forbes was obliged to go that morning to boston  to remain
until the following evening  he did not see his wife before he
left  had not seen her since the interview in the library  she had
locked herself in her room  and he was not the man to hammer on a
sulking woman’s door 

several men he knew were in his car  and he talked with them until
the train reached boston  there he was engrossed  he had barely time
to snatch a few hours for sleep  none for thought  but the next day 
after taking his chair in the train for new york  and observing that
he knew no one in the car  he became aware that the heart within him
was heavy  he and his wife had quarrelled before  for she had a hot
southern temper  and he was by no means without gunpowder of his own 
but none of their disputes had left behind it the flavour of this  that
she should tolerate such a man as bosworth  had disappointed him  that
she should espouse his pretensions to their only child  filled him with
disgust and something like terror  and her snobbery sickened him  but
what had stabbed into the quick of his heart were her final words  he
repeated them again and again  hoping to dull their edge 

moreover  she had never let the night set its ugly seal on their
quarrels  her tempers were soon over  and she had invariably come to
him and commanded or coaxed for reconciliation  as her mood dictated 
he had steered safely through the first trying years of matrimony  and
it appalled him to think that perhaps an unreckoned future lay before
them both 

when he entered his house something struck him as out of the common  a
servant had fetched his portmanteau from the cab  it suddenly occurred
to mr  forbes that the man had ostentatiously evaded his eye 

he walked toward the stair  hesitated  then turned 

“is mrs  forbes well?” he asked  and he found that he was making an
effort to control his voice 

the man flushed and hung his head  “mrs  forbes and miss augusta
sailed for europe this afternoon  sir  there’s a letter for you on the
mantel piece in the library ”

mr  forbes did not trust himself to say  “ah!” as he turned the knob
of the library door his hand trembled  he entered  and locked the door
behind him 

he opened the letter at once and read it 

  “i think you did not understand on monday night that i was in
  earnest ” it ran  “i am so much in earnest that i shall not stay here
  to bicker with you  that we have never done  i do not wish to run the
  risk of speaking again as i spoke the last time we were together  i
  know that i hurt you  and i am very sorry  if i did not believe that
  you were entirely wrong in the stand you have taken  i should not
  think of taking any decisive step in the matter myself  for it hurts
  me to hurt you  please believe that  but i feel sure that as soon
  as you are alone and think it over calmly  you will see that your
  opposition is hardly warrantable  and that the wishes of your wife and
  daughter are worthy of serious consideration  if we remained to renew
  the subject constantly you would not give it this consideration  there
  would be an undignified and regrettable war of words every day 

  “this is what i have made up my mind to do  if you persist in refusing
  your consent  which i cannot believe  i shall  on the tenth day of
  march  turn over all my own property to the duke  my houses in newport
  and asheville  my horses and yacht  and my jewels  two days later they
  will marry  i stand pledged to these two people that they shall marry 
  and nothing will induce me to break my word 

  “i sail to day with augusta on the  brétagne   i go to paris
  first to order the trousseau  my address will be the ‘bristol’  but
  i shall only be in paris a week  from there i shall go to london  to
  the ‘bristol ’ the duke and fletcher cuyler sail to day on the
   majestic  

  “i am afraid i have expressed myself brutally  my head aches  i am
  very nervous  i can hardly get my thoughts together  with all this
  hurry and confusion  and the unhappy knowledge that i am displeasing
  you  but this cloud that has fallen between us can be brushed aside 
  we can be happy again  and at once  it only rests with you 

                                             “virginia 

  “i have told harriet to make a plausible explanation of our abrupt
  departure  she has a talent for that sort of thing  no one need know
  that there has been the slightest difference of opinion ”

mr  forbes dropped the letter to the floor  and leaned forward  his
elbows digging into his knees  his hands pressed to his head 

he stared at the carpet his face was as white as if someone had struck
him a blow in a vital part  the tears gathered slowly in his eyes and
rolled over his cheeks  suddenly his hands covered his face  and sobs
shook him from head to foot 

“what have i loved?” he thought  “what have i loved? have i been in a
fool’s paradise for twenty two years? oh  my god!”

this woman had been the pre eminent consideration of the best years
of his life  he had loved her supremely  he had been faithful to her 
he had poured millions at her feet  delighted to gratify her love of
splendour and power  and never had a man seemed more justified  she had
half lived in his arms  she had been his comrade and friend  a source
of sympathy and repose and diversion and happiness that had never
failed him  for nearly a quarter of a century  and now she had sold
him  trodden in the dirt his will  his pride  his heart  that she might
finger a coronet which could never be hers  but gloat over the tarnish
on her fingers 

he sat there for many hours  dinner was announced  but he paid no
heed  he reviewed his married life  it had seemed to him very nearly
perfect  it lost nothing in the retrospect  he doubted if many men were
as happy as he had been  if many women had as much to give to a man as
virginia forbes  and now it had come to a full stop  to be resumed 
pitted and truncated  in another chapter  the delight of being petted
and spoiled and adored by a man whom all men respected  the love and
communion upon which she had seemed passionately dependent  were chaff
in the scale against her personal and social vanities 

life had been very kind to him  money  position  influential friends
had been his birthright  his talents had been recognised in his early
manhood  he had turned his original thousands into millions  no man in
the united states stood higher in the public estimation  nor could have
had a wider popularity  had he chosen to send his magnetism to the
people  no american was more hospitably received abroad  probably no
man living was the object of more kindly envy  and yet he sat alone in
his magnificent house and asked himself  “for what were mortals born?”
his heart ached so that he could have torn it out and trampled on it 
and the gall that bit the raw wound was the knowledge that he must go
on loving this woman so long as life was in him 




chapter xviii 


mrs  forbes and her daughter had been in london two weeks 
the engagement had been announced by the duke a week previously  and
was the sensation of the hour  the american newspapers were agog 
but  as mr  forbes refused to be interviewed  were obliged to content
themselves with daily bulletins from london  mr  forbes’ opposition
was suspected  but could not be verified  when congratulated  he
replied diplomatically that he was not a warm advocate of international
marriages  he hedged with a sense of bitter abasement  but he could not
fling his dignity into the public maw 

mrs  van rhuys informed people that  personally  her brother liked
the duke of bosworth  but had hoped that augusta would marry an
american  she could not name the exact amount of the dowry  several
millions  probably  the duke seemed singularly indifferent  he wished
the marriage to take place at once and in england  that his mother 
who idolized him  might be present  wherefore the sudden move  as the
trousseau was of far more importance than the breaking of a dozen
social engagements  mr  forbes would go over for the wedding  of
course  unless this dreadful financial muddle prevented  she and her
brother in law  schuyler van rhuys  who was nursing the wound inflicted
by that unintelligible californian  helena belmont  should go  in any
case  no  the duke had not jilted mabel creighton  on the contrary 
mabel might be said to have made the match  she and the duke had known
each other for a long while  and were the best of friends  nothing more 

all the folk in london of the duke’s set had called on mrs  forbes and
the impending duchess  as parliament was sitting  there was a goodly
number of them  the united states ambassador gave a banquet in honour
of the engagement  and it was the first of many attentions 

but the duke was a man in whom few beyond his intimate circle took
personal interest  he was cold  repellent  unpicturesque  the heiress
had neither beauty nor the thistle down attraction of the average
american girl  it was virginia forbes who introduced a singular
variation into this important but hackneyed transaction  and atoned for
the paucities of the principal figures  she absorbed something more
than two thirds of the public attention  her beauty  her distinction 
her lively wit  her exquisite taste in dress  her jewels  above all
her girlish appearance  commanded the reluctant admiration or the
subtle envy of the women  the enthusiasm of the men  and the unflagging
attentions of the weekly press  her ancestry was suddenly discovered 
and was a mine of glittering and illimited strata  her photograph was
printed in every paper which aimed to amuse a great and weary people 
and was on sale in the shops  in short  she was the “news” of the hour 
and the twentieth of his line and the lady who would save the entail
were the mere mechanism selected by circumstance to steer a charming
woman to her regalities 

“you certainly ought to be in a state of unleavened bliss ” remarked
her daughter with some sarcasm one evening as they sat together after
tea  alone for the hour  “you simply laid your plans  sailed over  and
down went london  i never knew anything quite so neat in my life  but
it is in some people’s lines to get everything they want  and i suppose
you will to the end of the chapter ”

mrs  forbes was gazing into the fire through the sticks of a fan  her
face was without its usual colour and her lips were contracted 

“not a line from your father  and it is three weeks ” she said abruptly 

“you did not expect  him   father!  to come round in a whirl  i
suppose  but why do you worry so? you know that it can end in one way
only  we are all he has  and he adores us  and cannot live without us 
it isn’t as if he were fast  like so many new york men  i have not
worried  not for a moment ”

“how can you be so cold blooded? i wish you knew the wretch i feel  if
he does adore us  cannot you comprehend what we are making him suffer?
sometimes i think i can never make it up to him  not with all the
devotion i am capable of  after this miserable business is over ”

“mother! you are not weakening? you will not retreat now that you have
gone so far?”

“i have no intention of retreating  but i wish that i had stayed in new
york and fought it out there  it was a shocking and heartless thing to
run away and leave him like that  a brutal and insulting thing  but
when he told me that he should pull mr  creighton through  and speak to
the duke  this move seemed the only one that could save the game ”

“and a very wise one it was  father would have beaten you in the
end  surely  he can do anything with you  i think it is humiliating to
be part and parcel of a man like that ”

“you know nothing of love  you are fascinated by a man who has the
magnetism of indifference  that is all ”

“i am quite sure that i love bertie ” said miss forbes with decision 
“i have analyzed myself thoroughly  and i feel convinced that it is
love  although i thank my stars that i could never in any circumstances
be so besottedly in love with a man as you are with dear papa  i do
not pretend to deny that i am pleased  very pleased  at the idea of
being a duchess  all we american girls of the best families have good
blue english blood in our veins  and it seems to me that in accepting
the best that the mother country can offer us  we should feel no
more flattered or excited than any english born girl in the same
circumstances  for the  nouveau riche   the fungi  of course it is
ridiculous  and also lamentable  they muddy a pure stream  and they are
chromos in a jewelled frame  but there are many of us that should feel
a certain gratitude to providence that we are permitted to save from
ruin the grand old families whose ancestors and ours played together 
perhaps  as children  to me it is a sacred duty as well as a very great
pleasure  papa’s english ancestors may not have been as smart as yours 
but he has seven generations of education and refinement  position and
wealth behind him in the united states  he is the chief figure in the
aristocracy of the united states  and in time he must see things as we
do ”

to this edifying homily mrs  forbes gave scant attention  she was
tormented with conjectures of her husband’s scorn and displeasure 
picturing his loneliness  sometimes she awoke suddenly in the night 
lost the drift for the moment of conversation in company  saw a blank
wall instead of the  mise en scène  of the play  her brain
flaring with the enigma  “will life ever be quite the same again?” she
had had a second object in leaving new york abruptly  she believed
that her husband could not stand the test of her absence and anger 
but in the excitement and rush of those two days she had not looked
into her deeper knowledge of him  she had known him very well  it was a
dangerous experiment to wound a great nature  to shatter the delicate
partition between illusion and an analytical mind 

“what a dreadful sigh!” expostulated miss forbes  “it is bad for the
heart to sigh like that  i don’t think you are very well  i don’t
think  lovely as you look  that you have been quite up to mark since we
left new york ”

“i suppose it is because i was ill crossing  i never was before  you
know  and then it is the first time in my life that i have been away
from both your father and mammy  i am so used to being taken care of
that i feel as if i were doing the wrong thing all the time  and marie
is merely a toilette automaton  this morning the clothes were half off
the bed when i woke up  and the window was open  and yesterday marie
gave me the wrong wrap  and i was cold all the afternoon ”

“good heavens  mother!” cried miss forbes  “fancy being thirty nine and
such a baby  i feel years older than you ”

“and immeasurably superior  i suppose the petting and care i have had
all my life would bore you  well  your cold independent nature often
makes me wonder what are its demands upon happiness  does bertie ever
kiss you?”

“occasionally  but i don’t care much about kissing  we discuss the
questions of the day ”

“poor man!”

“i am sure that he likes it  and we shall get along admirably  i am the
stronger nature  and i feel reasonably certain that i shall acquire
great influence over him  and make an exemplary man of him ”

“great heavens!” thought mrs  forbes  “a plain passionless
pseudo intellectual girl reforming an english profligate! what a sight
for the gods!”

“i hope papa will come round before the wedding  because i wish only
the interest of my dowry settled on us  and it takes a man to hold out
on that point  that would give me the upper hand in a way  you have not
written to him since we left  have you?”

“no ”

“don’t you think it is time?”

“i intend to write by to morrow’s steamer ”

“do make him really understand that he is forcing you to sacrifice the
houses and jewels to which you are so much attached ”

“i shall make it as strong as i can ”

“i’ll write to aunt harriet  and tell her to talk to him  poor dear
papa  i am afraid he is lonesome  i wish he would come over so that we
could all be together again  give him my love and a kiss ”

“you certainly have a magnificent sense of humour ”




chapter xix 


mr  forbes read his wife’s second letter with dry eyes  his
face  during the past weeks  had been habitually hard and severe  he
looked older  it was a long letter  it was fragrant with love and
admitted remorse  but it reasserted that unless he made the required
settlement three weeks from receipt she would hand over to the duke’s
attorneys all she possessed 

mr  forbes tore the letter into strips and threw them on the fire 
his face had flushed as he read  and as he lay back in his chair  it
relaxed somewhat 

“if she were here would i yield?” he thought  “i am thankful that she
is not  or am i? i don’t know  what fools we mortals be  in the hands
of a woman  five millions seem a small price to have her back  but
to pay them  unfortunately  means the free gift of my self respect 
what is to come? what is to come? i had believed at times that this
woman read my very soul and touched it  her intuitions  her sympathy 
her subtle comprehension of the highest wants of a man’s nature and
reverence for them amounted to something like genius  indeed  she had a
genius for loving  a most uncommon gift  or so it seemed to me  but i
think that few men would appreciate that they were idealising a woman
like virginia forbes  and now? i am to take back the beautiful woman 
the companionable mind  i suppose  nothing more  but it is something
to have been a fool for twenty two years  i cannot say that i have any
regrets  and possibly it was my own fault that i could not make her
love me better ”

he looked up at the picture  “several times ” he thought  “i have felt
like mounting a chair and kissing it  and if i did  i should feel as if
i were kissing the lips of a corpse ”

“ned! are you there?”

mr  forbes rose instantly  the door had opened  and a tall woman  not
unlike augusta  but with something more of mellowness  had entered 

“i am glad to see you  harriet ” he said  “what brings you at this
hour? have you come to help me through my solitary dinner?”

“i will stay to dinner  certainly ” mrs  van rhuys took the chair he
offered  and looked at him keenly  “i have just received a letter
from augusta ” she said  “do withdraw your opposition  ned  yield
gracefully  before the world knows what it is beginning to suspect  and
a man can never hold out against his womankind  he might just as well
give in at once and save wrinkles ”

“what is your personal opinion of the duke of bosworth?” asked mr 
forbes curtly 

“well  i certainly should have chosen a finer sample of the english
aristocracy for augusta  but i cannot sympathise with your violent
antipathy to him  his manners are remarkably good for an englishman 
and it would be one of the most notable marriages in american history ”

“you women are all alike ” said mr  forbes contemptuously  “would you
give your daughter to this man?”

“assuredly  i am positive that when the little duke settles down he
will be all that could be desired  he has something to live for now 
poor thing! he has been hampered with debts ever since he came of age 
the old duke was a sad profligate  but a very charming man  what it
is i do not pretend to define  and i say it without any snobbishness 
for i am devoted to new york  but there is something about the english
aristocracy    ”

“oh!”  mr  forbes rattled the shovel among the coals  “do  please 
spare me  you’re all peer bewitched  every one of you  don’t let us
discuss the subject any farther  it is loathsome to me  and i am
ashamed of my womankind ”

“are you determined to let virginia sell her houses and jewels  ned? it
will break her heart ”

“she knew what she was doing when she struck the bargain  it was an
entirely voluntary act on her part  i see no reason why she should not
stand the consequences  shall we go in to dinner?”




chapter xx 


the next evening miss forbes dressed for a dinner party in a
very bad humour 

her mother was prostrated with a violent headache and had been obliged
to send an excuse 

“such a dreadful thing to do ” grumbled augusta to her maid as she
revolved before the pier glass  “have you asked marie the particulars?
is my mother really ill?”

“dreadful  i believe  miss ”

“it makes me feel heartless to leave her  but one of us must go  that
is certain  can i see her?”

“no  miss  she is trying to sleep ”

“people may have an idea that the path of an american heiress who is
going to marry an english duke is strewn with jacqueminots  i wish they
knew what i have gone through in the last month  i wish to heaven papa
would come over ”

it was a bright and lively dinner given by a very young and
newly titled united statesian  who treated the british peerage as a
large and lovely joke  and was accepted on much the same footing  the
duke  who had pulled himself together since the swerve in his fortunes 
looked something more of a man  his cheeks had more colour and his
eye belongings less  he held himself erectly and talked well  augusta
bored him hideously  but he reflected that a duke need see little of
his duchess  and filled his present  rôle  creditably  fletcher
cuyler as usual was the life of the company  and even augusta forgot to
be intellectual 

a theatre party followed the dinner  augusta returned to the hotel
a little after midnight  as she opened the door of the private
drawing room of mrs  forbes’ suite  she saw with surprise that her
mother was sitting by one of the tables 

“i thought you were in bed with a headache ” she began  and then
uttered an exclamation of alarm and went hastily forward 

mrs  forbes  as white as the dead  her hair unbound and dishevelled 
her eyes swollen  sat with clenched hands pressed hard against her
cheeks 

“mother!” exclaimed augusta  “you  you look terribly  how you must have
suffered  has the pain gone?”

“yes  the pain has gone ”

“well  i am glad you are better    ”

“it will be a long while before i am better  oh  i want your father!
cable to him! go for him! do anything  only bring him here ”

“i’ll cable this minute if you are really ill  but what is the matter?”

mrs  forbes muttered something  augusta bent her ear  “what?” she
asked  her mother repeated what she had said  as augusta lifted her
head her face was scarlet 

“gracious goodness!” she ejaculated  “who would ever have thought of
such a thing?” she walked aimlessly to the window  then returned to her
mother  “well ” she added  “it’s nothing to be so upset about  it isn’t
as if it were your first  and papa will be delighted ”

mrs  forbes flung her arms over the table  her head upon them  and
burst into wild sobbing 

“good heavens  mother  don’t take on so ” cried her daughter  “what
good could papa do if he were here? i hope i’ll never have a baby if
it affects one like that ”

she hovered over her mother  much embarrassed  she was not heartless
and would have been glad to relieve her distress  but inasmuch as she
was incapable of such distress herself she comprehended not the least
of what possessed her mother  she took refuge upon the plane where she
was ever at home 

“i have always said ” she announced  “that it is not a good thing for
american men to spoil their wives as they do  and particularly as papa
spoils you  here you are in the most ordinary predicament that can
befall a woman  and yet you are utterly demoralized because he is not
here to pet you and make you think you are the only woman that ever had
a baby  and upon my word ” she added reflectively  “i believe he would
be perfectly happy if he were here  i can just see the fuss he would
make over you    ”

here her mother’s sobs became so violent that she was roused to genuine
concern 

“i’ll cable at once ” she said  “but what shall i cable? i don’t know
how to intimate such a thing  and i certainly can’t say it right out ”

“i will write  give me the things ” mrs  forbes raised her disfigured
face and pushed back her hair  “it will make me feel better  of course
you cannot cable without alarming him  and he has had enough ”

augusta brought the writing materials with alacrity  mrs  forbes wrote
two lines  the tears splashed on the paper 

“those will look like real tears ” said augusta reassuringly  “once
i helped mabel write a letter breaking off an engagement  and she
sprinkled it with the hair brush  i am sure he must have guessed  here 
i’ll send it right away  and then you’ll feel better ”

she summoned a bell boy and dispatched the letter  “there!” she said 
patting her mother’s head  “he’ll be sure to come over now  and all
will go as merry as a marriage bell  my marriage bell  tell me  mamma 
don’t you feel that this is a special little intervention of providence
to bring things about just as we want them? aren’t you glad that this
is the end of doubt and worry  and that you can keep your houses and
lovely jewels?”

“i don’t know ” said mrs  forbes wearily  “i want nothing but my
husband ”




chapter xxi 


the week passed  no cable came from mr  forbes  his wife did
not admit further disquiet  she knew his pride  he would come  but not
with the appearance of hastening to her at the first excuse 

she went out as much as she could  filled every moment  a part of the
trousseau arrived  and there were many things to be bought in london 

she needed all the distraction she could devise  impatience and
longing  regret and loneliness crouched at the four corners of her
mind  ready to spring the moment her will relaxed  the gloomy skies
contributed their quota  she was home sick for the blue and white  the
electric atmosphere of new york  nevertheless  when she was surrounded
by admirers  during the hours wherein she was reminded that her haughty
little head was among the stars  she was content  and had no thought of
retreat 

the letter had left england on a saturday  she reckoned that her
husband would not receive it until the following monday week  making
allowance for all delays  he could take the steamer that left new york
on wednesday 

on the wednesday of the week succeeding she remained in her rooms
all day  the time came and passed for the arrival of passengers by
the “cunard” line  but her husband had a strong preference for the
“american ” and she had made up her mind not to expect him before a
quarter to nine in the evening  a slight break in the  st  paul’s 
machinery had delayed its arrival several hours 

she was nervous and excited  augusta left the hotel and declared that
she should not return until the “meeting was quite over ” for the last
week mrs  forbes had been haunted by visions of shipwreck  fire at
sea  and sudden death  in these last hours she walked the floor torn
by doubts of another nature  suppose her husband would not forgive
her  was disgusted  embittered? she had every reason to think that she
had deep and intimate knowledge of him  but she knew that people had
lived together for forty years before some crook of circumstance had
revealed the dormant but virile poison of their natures  was bitter
pride her husband’s? for the first time she wished that she had never
seen the duke of bosworth  retreated before the ambitions of a lifetime
in detestation and terror  every part of her concentrated into longing
for the man who had made the happiness of her life  she even wished
passionately that she had never had a daughter to come between them 
and with curious feminism loved the baby that was coming the more 

she went to the mirror and regarded herself anxiously  when in society 
excitement gave her all her old rich vital beauty  but the reaction
left her pale and dull  would he find her faded? he had worshipped her
beauty  and she would rather have walked out from wealth into poverty
than have discovered a wrinkle or a grey hair  but she looked very
lovely  her cheeks were flushed  her eyes sparkling  her warm soft hair
when hanging always enriched her beauty  she wore an empire gown of
pale pink satin cut in a high square about the throat 

“oh  i look pretty enough ” she thought  “if he would only come!”

for the twentieth time she went to the clock  it was a few minutes to
eight the train was due at twenty minutes past  he should be at the
hotel by a quarter to nine at latest 

the next hour was the longest of her life  she assured herself that if
there was such a result as retributive justice in this world it beat
upon her in a fiery rain during those crab like moments  there was
nothing to momentarily relieve the tension  no seconds of expectation 
of hope  the roll of cabs in the street was incessant  the corridors of
the hotel were so thickly carpeted that she could not hear a foot fall 
her very hands shook  but she dared not take an anodyne lest she should
not be herself when he came 

she tried to recall the few quarrels of her engagement and their
perturbing effect  they were such pale wraiths before this agitation 
following years of intense living  and quicked with the full knowledge
of the great possession she may have tossed to memory  that they
dissolved upon evocation  she sprang to her feet again to pace the
room  at that moment the door opened and her husband entered 

she had purposed to captivate him anew with her beauty  to shed several
tears  perhaps  but not enough to blister and inflame  she flew across
the room and flung herself about his neck and deluged his face with
tears  as she sobbed  and kissed him  and protested  and besought
forgiveness 

his face had been stern as he entered  although the appeal of her
letter was irresistible  he had no intention of capitulating without
reserves  but no man that loved a woman could be proof against such an
outburst of feeling and affection  and in a moment he was pressing her
in his arms and kissing her 




chapter xxii 


the next morning mr  forbes had an interview with augusta 

“i don’t choose to discuss this matter of your engagement with your
mother ” he said  “so we will come to an understanding at once  if you
please  are you determined to marry this man  to take your mother’s
property in case i continue to refuse my consent?”

“papa! what else can i do? the invitations are out  we should be the
laughingstock of two continents  besides  i am convinced that bertie is
the one man i shall ever want to marry  and i cannot give him up ”

“very well  you and your mother have beaten me  fortunately  you are
better able to stand the consequences of your acts than most women  i
doubt if you will ever realize them  i have an attorney here  he will
confer with the duke’s attorneys to morrow  only  be good enough to
arrange matters so that i shall see as little as possible of your duke
between now and the wedding  your mother and i shall return to america
the day after the ceremony ”

as mr  forbes left the room augusta thoughtfully arranged the chiffon
on the front of her blouse 

“even a big man ” she reflected  “a great big man  a man who can make
presidents of the united states  has no chance in the hands of two
determined women  we are quite dangerous when we know our power ”

she added after a moment 

“how gracefully he gave in  dear papa! but that is the american of it 
we never sulk  we lose our temper  we come down with both feet  we
even kick hard and long when we want or don’t want a thing badly  but
when we find that it’s all no use  i flatter myself that we know how to
climb down ”




chapter xxiii 


the next two weeks flashed by  besides the accumulating details
there were two visits to country houses and a daily breakfast or
dinner  mr  forbes  who had many friends in london  had no time
to be bored  mrs  forbes was happy and triumphant  augusta’s serene
components pleasurably oscillated 

the wedding was very brilliant  but not gorgeous  mrs  forbes was far
too clever to give society and the press an excuse to sneer at the
“vulgar display of american dollars ” st  george’s was decorated with
sufficient lavishness to make it appear a bower of delight after the
drive through rain and mud  but suggested to no mind the possible cost 


royalty came from cannes  the church was crowded to the doors with the
best blood in england  the dowager duchess  a stout plainly garbed old
lady  sat with her daughters and grandchildren  she looked placid and
rather sleepy  mrs  forbes  who was gowned in violet velvet with a
point lace vest of new device  was flanked by her husband’s relatives
and the united states embassy  augusta  in a magnificent bridal robe of
satin and lace and pearls  her severely cut features softened by the
white mist of her veil  looked stately and imposing  the maidens who
flanked her were not the friends of her youth  but their names were
writ in the style of chivalry  and augusta’s equanimity was independent
of sentiment  the duke’s bump of benevolence was on a level with her
small well placed ear  but he also looked his best 

as mrs  forbes listened to the words which affiliated her with several
of the greatest houses in the history of europe  she thrilled with
gratified ambition and the more strictly feminine pleasure of having
her own way  suddenly her glance rested on her husband  he stood with
his arms folded  his eyes lowered  an expression of bitter defeat on
his face 

the blood dropped from her cheeks to her heart  the rosy atmosphere
turned grey  “he says that he has forgiven me ” she thought  “has he?
has he? but i will make him! any impressions can be effaced with time
and persistence  and others that are ever present ”

after the ceremony there was a breakfast at the embassy  only the
members of the two families  the few intimate friends  and the
bridesmaids were present  the company was barely seated when fletcher
cuyler rose  leaned his finger tips lightly on the table and glanced
about with his affable and impish grin 

“ladies and gentlemen  your attention if you please ” he commanded 
“i wish the individually expressed thanks of each member of this
assemblage  not for being the happy instrument in bringing this
auspicious marriage about  although i confess the imputation  but for a
more immediate benefit  one which i have conferred equally upon each of
you  and upon the many hundreds who were so fortunate as to witness the
ceremony which bound together two of the most distinguished families of
america and great britain  i allude to the wedding march  you doubtless
noticed that it was played as it should be  as it rarely is  i have
attended twenty two weddings in st  george’s    ”

“sit down  fletcher ” said the first secretary impatiently  “what are
you talking about? do kindly take a back seat for once ”

“on the contrary  i am entitled to a high chair in the front row  i
played that march  you do not believe me? ask the organist  when he is
able to articulate  he is red hot and speechless at present  i calmly
approached him as he was pulling out his cuffs  and said  ‘young man’
(he is venerable  but i too am bald)  ‘move aside if you please  i
am to play this wedding march  the duke of bosworth is my particular
friend  it is my way of giving him good luck  at once  there is the
signal ’ i fancy i hypnotized him  he slid off the stool mechanically 
i lost no time taking his place  when he had recovered and was
threatening police i was playing as even i had never played before 
that is all ”

everybody laughed  the duke more heartily than anyone  fletcher was one
of the few of life’s gifts for which he was consistently thankful 

“you shall come with us to day ” he said  delighted with the sudden
inspiration  and fletcher  who had intended to go whether he was
invited or not  graciously accepted 

the breakfast party was informal and gay  toasts were given and the
responses clever  even mr  forbes  who had no idea of being a death’s
head at a feast  forced himself into his best vein 

the duke drank a good deal of wine and said little  he was  on the
whole  well content  mr  forbes had handed over two hundred thousand
pounds with which to repair aire castle  and settled the income of
eight hundred thousand pounds on the young people  the principal to go
to their children  the duke reflected gratefully that he should have
no cause to be ashamed of his bride  she was not beautiful  but even
his relatives had approved of her manners and style  he forgave her for
having bored him  for she had brought him a certain peace of mind  and
she should have as many m p ’s to talk political economy to as she (or
they) listed  he would talk to fletcher  and others 

mrs  forbes had her especial toasts  even here  at this anti climax
dear to the heart of a bride  she was the personage  she looked regal
and surpassing fair  for her eyes were very soft  and she had never
been happier of speech  the duke  who admired her with what enthusiasm
was left in him  proposed a toast to which the ambassador himself
responded 




chapter xxiv 


when it was over and mr  forbes and his wife had returned to
the hotel  she put her hands on his shoulders and looked him in the
eyes 

“tell me ” she said imperiously  “have you really forgiven me? i have
almost been sure at times that you had  i have felt it  but you have
not been quite your old dear self  i want to hear you say again that
you forgive me  and it is the last time that i shall refer to the
subject ”

“yes ” he said  adjusting a lock that had fallen over her ear  “i have
forgiven you  of course  we are to live the rest of our lives together 
i am not so unwise  i hope  as to nurse offended pride and resentment ”

the colour left her face  she came closer 

“tell me!” she said  her voice vibrating  “won’t it ever be quite the
same again? is that what you mean?”

he took her in his arms and laid his cheek against hers  “oh  i don’t
know ” he said  “i don’t know ”
