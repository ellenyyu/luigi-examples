foreword


food will win the war  and the nation whose food resources are best
conserved will be the victor  this is the truth that our government
is trying to drive home to every man  woman and child in america  we
have always been happy in the fact that ours was the richest nation
in the world  possessing unlimited supplies of food  fuel  energy
and ability  but rich as these resources are they will not meet
the present food shortage unless every family and every individual
enthusiastically co operates in the national saving campaign as
outlined by the united states food administration 

the regulations prescribed for this saving campaign are simple and
easy of application  our government does not ask us to give up three
square meals a day  nor even one  all it asks is that we substitute as
far as possible corn and other cereals for wheat  reduce a little our
meat consumption and save sugar and fats by careful utilization of
these products 

there are few housekeepers who are not eager to help in this saving
campaign  and there are few indeed who do not feel the need of
conserving family resources  but just how is sometimes a difficult
task 

this book is planned to solve the housekeeper s problem  it shows how
to substitute cereals and other grains for wheat  how to cut down
the meat bill by the use of meat extension and meat substitute dishes
which supply equivalent nutrition at much less cost  it shows the use
of syrup and other products that save sugar  and it explains how to
utilize all kinds of fats  it contains 47 recipes for the making of
war breads  64 recipes on low cost meat dishes and meat substitutes 
54 recipes for sugarless desserts  menus for meatless and wheatless
days  methods of purchasing  in all some two hundred ways of meeting
present food conditions at minimum cost and without the sacrifice of
nutrition 

not only have its authors planned to help the woman in the home 
conserve the family income  but to encourage those saving habits which
must be acquired by this nation if we are to secure a permanent peace
that will insure the world against another onslaught by the prussian
military powers 

a little bit of saving in food means a tremendous aggregate total 
when 100 000 000 people are doing the saving  one wheatless meal a
day would not mean hardship  there are always corn and other products
to be used  yet one wheatless meal a day in every family would mean a
saving of 90 000 000 bushels of wheat  which totals 5 400 000 000 lbs 
two meatless days a week would mean a saving of 2 200 000 lbs  of meat
per annum  one teaspoonful of sugar per person saved each day would
insure a supply ample to take care of our soldiers and our allies 
these quantities mean but a small individual sacrifice  but when
multiplied by our vast population they will immeasurably aid and
encourage the men who are giving their lives to the noble cause of
humanity on which our nation has embarked

out under the direction of grace e  frysinger  graduate in domestic
science of drexel institute  of philadelphia  and the university
of chicago  miss frysinger  who has had nine years  experience as
a teacher of domestic science  has earnestly used her skill to make
these recipes practical for home use  and at the same time accurate
and scientific

save wheat

 reasons why our government asks us to save wheat  with practical
recipes for the use of other grains 


a slice of bread seems an unimportant thing  yet one good sized slice
of bread weighs an ounce  it contains almost three fourths of an ounce
of flour 

if every one of the country s 20 000 000 homes wastes on the average
only one such slice of bread a day  the country is throwing away
daily over 14 000 000 ounces of flour  over 875 000 pounds  or enough
flour for over a million one pound loaves a day  for a full year
at this rate there would be a waste of over 319 000 000 pounds of
flour  1 500 000 barrels  enough flour to make 365 000 000 loaves 

as it takes four and one half bushels of wheat to make a barrel
of ordinary flour  this waste would represent the flour from over
7 000 000 bushels of wheat  fourteen and nine tenths bushels of wheat
on the average are raised per acre  it would take the product of some
470 000 acres just to provide a single slice of bread to be wasted
daily in every home 

but some one says   a full slice of bread is not wasted in every
home   very well  make it a daily slice for every four or every ten
or every thirty homes  make it a weekly or monthly slice in every
home  or make the wasted slice thinner  the waste of flour involved
is still appalling  these are figures compiled by government experts 
and they should give pause to every housekeeper who permits a slice of
bread to be wasted in her home 

another source of waste of which few of us take account is home made
bread  sixty per cent  of the bread used in america is made in the
home  when one stops to consider how much home made bread is poorly
made  and represents a large waste of flour  yeast and fuel  this
housewifely energy is not so commendable  the bread flour used in the
home is also in the main wheat flour  and all waste of wheat at the
present time increases the shortage of this most necessary food 

fuel  too  is a serious national problem  and all coal used in either
range  gas  or electric oven for the baking of poor bread is an actual
national loss  there must be no waste in poor baking or from poor care
after the bread is made  or from the waste of a crust or crumb 

waste in your kitchen means starvation in some other kitchen across
the sea  our allies are asking for 450 000 000 bushels of wheat 
and we are told that even then theirs will be a privation loaf  crop
shortage and unusual demand has left canada and the united states 
which are the largest sources of wheat  with but 300 000 000 bushels
available for export  the deficit must be met by reducing consumption
on this side the atlantic  this can be done by eliminating waste and
by making use of cereals and flours other than wheat in bread making 

the wide use of wheat flour for bread making has been due to custom 
in europe rye and oats form the staple breads of many countries  and
in some sections of the south corn bread is the staff of life  we have
only to modify a little our bread eating habits in order to meet the
present need  other cereals can well be used to eke out the wheat  but
they require slightly different handling 

in making yeast breads  the essential ingredient is gluten  which
is extended by carbon dioxide gas formed by yeast growth  with the
exception of rye  grains other than wheat do not contain sufficient
gluten for yeast bread  and it is necessary to use a wheat in varying
proportions in order to supply the deficient gluten  even the baker s
rye loaf is usually made of one half rye and one half wheat  this is
the safest proportion for home use in order to secure a good texture 

when oatmeal is used  it is necessary to scald the oatmeal to prevent
a raw taste  oatmeal also makes a softer dough than wheat  and it
is best to make the loaf smaller and bake it longer  about one hour
instead of the forty five minutes which we allow for wheat bread 

the addition of one third barley flour to wheat flour makes a light
colored  good flavored bread  if a larger proportion than this is
used  the loaf has a decided barley flavor  if you like this flavor
and increase the proportion of barley  be sure to allow the dough a
little longer time to rise  as by increasing the barley you weaken the
gluten content of your loaf 

rice and cornmeal can be added to wheat breads in a 10 per cent 
proportion  laboratory tests have shown that any greater proportion
than this produces a heavy  small loaf 

potato flour or mashed potato can be used to extend the wheat  it
being possible to work in almost 50 per cent  of potato  but this
makes a darker and moister loaf than when wheat alone is used  in
order to take care of this moisture  it is best to reserve part of
the wheat for the second kneading 

graham and entire wheat flour also effect a saving of wheat because
a larger percentage of the wheat berry is used  graham flour is
the whole kernel of wheat  ground  entire wheat flour is the flour
resulting from the grinding of all but the outer layer of wheat  a
larger use of these coarser flours will therefore help materially
in eking out our scant wheat supply as the percentage of the wheat
berry used for bread flour is but 72 per cent  breads made from these
coarser flours also aid digestion and are a valuable addition to the
dietary 

in order to keep down waste by eliminating the poor batch of bread 
it is necessary to understand the principles of bread making 
fermentation is the basic principle of yeast bread  and fermentation
is controlled by temperature  the yeast plant grows at a temperature
from 70 to 90 degrees (fahrenheit)  and if care is taken to maintain
this temperature during the process of fermentation  waste caused by
sour dough or over fermentation will be eliminated  when we control
the temperature we can also reduce the time necessary for making a
loaf of bread  or several loaves of bread as may be needed  into as
short a period as three hours  this is what is known as the quick
method  it not only saves time and labor  but  controlling the
temperature  insures accurate results  the easiest way to control the
temperature is to put the bowl containing the dough into another of
slightly larger size containing water at a temperature of 90 degrees 
the water of course should never be hot  hot water kills the yeast
plant  cold water checks its growth  cover the bowl and set it in the
gas oven or fireless cooker or on the shelf of the coal range  as the
water in the large bowl cools off  remove a cupful and add a cupful of
hot water  at the end of one and one half hours the dough should have
doubled in bulk  take it out of the pan and knead until the large gas
bubbles are broken (about ten minutes)  then place in greased bread
pans and allow to rise for another half hour  at the end of this time
it will not only fill the pan  but will project out of it  do not
allow the dough to rise too high  for then the bread will have large
holes in it  a good proportion as a general rule to follow  is 

  3 1/2 cupfuls of flour (this includes added cereals)
  1 cupful of water or milk
  1/2 tablespoon shortening
  1 1/2 teaspoons salt
  1 cake of compressed yeast

    in this recipe sugar has been omitted because of the serious
    shortage  but after the war a teaspoon of sugar should be
    added  the shortening  although small in quantity  may also be
    omitted 

these materials make a loaf of about one pound  which should be
baked in forty to fifty minutes at a temperature of 450 degrees
(fahrenheit)  allow a little longer time for bread containing oatmeal
or other grains  such breads require a little longer baking and
a little lower temperature than wheat breads  if you do not use a
thermometer in testing your oven  place a piece of paper on the center
shelf  and if it browns in two minutes your oven is right  if a longer
period for raising is allowed than is suggested in the above recipe 
the yeast proportion should be decreased  for overnight bread use
one quarter yeast cake per loaf  for six hour bread  use one half
yeast cake per loaf  for three hour bread  use one yeast cake per
loaf  in baking  the time allowed should depend on the size of the
loaf  when baked at a temperature of 450 degrees  large loaves take
from forty five to sixty minutes  small loaves from thirty to forty
minutes  rolls from ten to twenty minutes 

it is well to divide the oven time into four parts  during the first
quarter  the rising continues  second quarter  browning begins  the
third quarter  browning is finished  the fourth quarter  bread shrinks
from the side of the pan  these are always safe tests to follow in
your baking  when baked  the bread should be turned out of the pans
and allow to cool on a wire rack  when cool  put the bread in a stone
crock or bread box  to prevent staleness  keep the old bread away from
the fresh  scald the bread crock or give your bread box a sun bath at
frequent intervals 

even with all possible care to prevent waste  yeast breads will not
conserve our wheat supply so well as quick breads  because all yeast
breads need a larger percentage of wheat  the home baker can better
serve her country by introducing into her menus numerous quick
breads that can be made from cornmeal  rye  corn and rye  hominy  and
buckwheat  griddle cakes and waffles can also be made from lentils 
soy beans  potatoes  rice and peas 

do not expect that the use of other cereals in bread making will
reduce the cost of your bread  that is not the object  saving of wheat
for war needs is the thing we are striving for  and this is as much
an act of loyalty as buying liberty bonds  it is to meet the crucial
world need of bread that we are learning to substitute  and not to
spare the national purse 

besides this saving of wheat  our government also asks us to omit
all fat from our yeast breads in order to conserve the diminishing
fat supply  this may seem impossible to the woman who has never made
bread without shortening  but recent experiments in bread making
laboratories have proved that bread  without shortening  is just
as light and as good in texture as that made with shortening  the
only difference being a slight change in flavor  these experiments
have also shown that it is possible to supply shortening by the
introduction of 3 per cent  to 5 per cent  of canned cocoanut or of
peanut butter  and that sugar may also be omitted from bread making
recipes  in fact  the war is bringing about manifold interesting
experiments which prove that edible and nutritious bread can be made
of many things besides the usual white flour 

the recipes herewith appended  showing the use of combinations of
cereals and wheat  have been carefully tested in the forecast school
of modern cookery  good bread can be made from each recipe  and the
new flavors obtained by the use of other grains make a pleasing and
wholesome variety 

a family which has eaten oatmeal or entire wheat bread will never
again be satisfied with a diet that includes only bread made from
bleached flour  children  especially  will be benefited by the change 
as the breads made from coarser flours are not only more nutritious 
but are rich in the minerals and vitamine elements that are so
essential to the growth of strong teeth  bones and growing tissues 

the homemaker  too  will never regret her larger acquaintance with
bread making materials  as the greater variety of breads that she will
find herself able to produce will be a source of pleasure and keen
satisfaction

of meat in the center of the picture  




save meat

 reasons why our government has asked us to save meat with practical
recipes for meat conservation 


as a nation we eat and waste 80 per cent  more meat than we require to
maintain health  this statement  recently issued by the united states
food administration  is appalling when we consider that there is a
greater demand for meat in the world to day than ever before  coupled
with a greatly decreased production  the increase in the demand for
meat and animal products is due to the stress of the war  millions of
men are on the fighting line doing hard physical labor  and require
a larger food allowance than when they were civilians  to meet
the demand for meat and to save their grains  our allies have been
compelled to kill upward of thirty three million head of their stock
animals  and they have thus stifled their animal production  this was
burning the candle at both ends  and they now face increased demand
handicapped by decreased production 

america must fill the breach  not only must we meet the present
increased demand  but we must be prepared as the war advances to meet
an even greater demand for this most necessary food  the way out of
this serious situation is first to reduce meat consumption to the
amount really needed and then to learn to use other foods that will
supply the food element which is found in meat  this element is called
protein  and we depend upon it to build and repair body tissues 

although most persons believe that protein can only be obtained
from meat  it is found in many other foods  such as milk  skim milk 
cheese  cottage cheese  poultry  eggs  fish  dried peas  beans  cow
peas  lentils and nuts  for instance  pound for pound  salmon  either
fresh or canned  equals round steak in protein content  cream cheese
contains one quarter more protein and three times as much fat  peanuts
(hulled) one quarter more protein and three and a half times as much
fat  beans (dried) a little more protein and one fifth as much fat 
eggs (one dozen) about the same in protein and one half more fat  it
is our manifest duty to learn how to make the best use of these foods
in order to save beef  pork and mutton  to be shipped across the sea 
this means that the housekeeper has before her the task of training
the family palate to accept new food preparations  training the family
palate is not easy  because bodies that have grown accustomed to
certain food combinations find it difficult to get along without them 
and rebel at a change  if these habits of diet are suddenly disturbed
we may upset digestion  as well as create a feeling of dissatisfaction
which is equally harmful to physical well being  the wise housekeeper
will therefore make her changes gradually 

in reducing meat in the diet of a family that has been used to having
meat twice a day  it will be well to start out with meat once a day
and keep up this régime for a couple of weeks  then drop meat for a
whole day  supplying in its stead a meat substitute dish that will
furnish the same nutriment  after a while you can use meat substitutes
at least twice a week without disturbing the family s mental or
physical equilibrium  it would be well also to introduce dishes
that extend the meat flavor  such as stews combined with dumplings 
hominy  or rice  pot pies or short cakes with a dressing of meat and
vegetables  meat loaf  souffle or croquettes in which meat is combined
with bread crumbs  potato or rice 

meat eating is largely a matter of flavor  if flavor is supplied 
the reduction of meat in the diet can be made with little annoyance 
nutrition can always be supplied in the other dishes that accompany
the meal  as a certain proportion of protein is found in almost every
food product  the meat that we use to obtain flavor in sauces and
gravies need not be large in quantity  nor expensive in cut  the poor
or cheap cuts have generally more flavor than the expensive ones 
the difference being entirely in texture and tenderness  freedom from
gristle and inedible tissue  there are many cereals  such as rice 
hominy  cornmeal  samp and many vegetable dishes  especially dried
beans of all kinds  that are greatly improved by the addition of meat
sauce and when prepared in this way may be served as the main dish of
a meal 

dr  harvey w  wiley has stated that the meat eating of the future will
not be regarded as a necessity so much as it has been in the past  and
that meat will be used more as a condimental substance  europe has for
years used meat for flavor rather than for nutriment  it would seem
that the time has come for americans to learn the use of meat for
flavor and to utilize more skillfully the protein of other foods 

it may be difficult to convince the meat lover that he can radically
reduce the proportion of meat in his diet without detriment to health 
many persons adhere to the notion that you are not nourished unless
you eat meat  that meat foods are absolutely necessary to maintain the
body strength  this idea is entirely without foundation  for the foods
mentioned as meat substitutes earlier in this chapter can be made to
feed the world  and feed it well  in fact  no nation uses so large a
proportion of meat as america 

the first step  therefore  in preparing ourselves to reduce meat
consumption is to recognize that only a small quantity of meat is
necessary to supply sufficient protein for adult life  the growing
child or the youth springing into manhood needs a larger percentage of
meat than the adult  and in apportioning the family s meat ration this
fact should not be overlooked 

the second step is to reduce the amount purchased  choosing cuts that
contain the least waste  and by utilizing with care that which we do
purchase  fat  trimmings  and bones all have their uses and should be
saved from the garbage pail 

careful buying  of course  depends on a knowledge of cuts  a study
of the percentage of waste in each cut  and the food value of the
different kinds of meat  make a study of the different cuts  as shown
in the charts on pages 36  37  and armed with this knowledge go forth
to the butcher for practical buying 

then comes the cooking  which can only be properly done when the
fundamental principles of the cooking processes  such as boiling 
braising  broiling  stewing  roasting and frying are understood 
each cut requires different handling to secure the maximum amount of
nutriment and flavor  the waste occasioned by improper cooking is a
large factor in both household and national economy 

it has been estimated that a waste of an ounce each day of edible meat
or fat in the twenty million american homes amounts to 456 000 000
pounds of valuable animal food a year  at average dressed weights 
this amounts to 875 000 steers  or over 3 000 000 hogs  each
housekeeper  therefore  who saves her ounce a day aids in this
enormous saving  which will mean so much in the feeding of our men on
the fighting line 

so the housekeeper who goes to her task of training the family palate
to accept meat substitutes and meat economy dishes  who revolutionizes
her methods of cooking so as to utilize even  the pig s squeak   will
be doing her bit toward making the world safe for democracy 

the following charts  tables of nutritive values and suggested menus
have been arranged to help her do this work  the american woman has
her share in this great world struggle  and that is the intelligent
conservation of food 


selection of meat

beef  dull red as cut  brighter after exposure to air  lean  well
mottled with fat  flesh  firm  fat  yellowish in color  best beef from
animal 3 to 5 years old  weighing 900 to 1 200 pounds  do not buy wet 
soft  or pink beef 

veal  flesh pink  (if white  calf was bled before killed or animal too
young ) the fat should be white 

mutton  best from animal 3 years old  flesh dull red  fat firm and
white 

lamb  (spring lamb 3 months to 6 months old  season  february to
march ) bones of lamb should be small  end of bone in leg of lamb
should be serrated  flesh pink  and fat white 

pork  the lean should be fine grained and pale pink  the skin should
be smooth and clear  if flesh is soft  or fat yellowish  pork is not
good 


selection of tougher cuts and their uses

less expensive cuts of meat have more nourishment than the more
expensive  and if properly cooked and seasoned  have as much
tenderness  tough cuts  as chuck or top sirloin  may be boned and
rolled and then roasted by the same method as tender cuts  the only
difference will be that the tougher cuts require longer cooking  have
the bones from rolled meats sent home to use for soups  corned beef
may be selected from flank  naval  plate or brisket  these cuts are
more juicy than rump or round cuts 

1   for pot roast  use chuck  crossrib  round  shoulder  rump or top
sirloin 

2   for stew  use shin  shoulder  top sirloin or neck 

3   for steaks  use flank  round or chuck  if these cuts are pounded 
or both pounded and rubbed with a mixture of 1 part vinegar and 2
parts oil before cooking  they will be very tender 

4   soups   buy shin or neck  the meat from these may be utilized
by serving with horseradish or mustard sauce  or combined with equal
amount of fresh meat for meat loaf  scalloped dish  etc 


dry methods

1   roasting or baking   oven roasting or baking is applied to roasts 

place the roast in a hot oven  or if gas is used  put in the broiling
oven to sear the outside quickly  and thus keep in the juices 
salt  pepper and flour  if an open roasting pan is used place a few
tablespoonfuls of fat and 1 cup of water in the pan  which should be
used to baste the roast frequently  if a covered pan is used basting
is unnecessary 

  beef or mutton   (5 to 8 lbs )  10 min  to the lb   10 min  extra
  lamb             (5 to 8 lbs )  12 min  to the lb   12 min  extra
  veal             (5 to 8 lbs )  15 min  to the lb   15 min  extra
  pork             (5 to 8 lbs )  25 min  to the lb   25 min  extra
  turkey                          20 min  to the lb 
  chicken                         30 min  to the lb 
  duck                            30 min  to the lb 
  goose                           30 min  to the lb 
  game                            30 min  to the lb 

2   broiling   cooking over or under clear fire  this method is used
for chops or steaks 

sear the meat on both sides  then reduce the heat and turn the meat
frequently  use no fat 

   time table   (count time after meat is seared) 
                1/2 inch chops or steaks  5 minutes
                  1 inch chops or steaks  10 minutes
                  2 inch chops or steaks  15 to 18 minutes

3   pan broiling   cooking in pan with no fat   time table same as for
broiling  chops  steaks  etc 

4   sautéing   cooking in pan in small amount of fat  commonly
termed  frying   used for steaks  chops  etc   time table same as for
broiling  


moist methods

1  boiling  cooking in boiling water  especially poultry  salt meats 
etc 

2  steaming  a method of cooking by utilizing steam from boiling
water  which retains more food value than any other  too seldom
applied to meats 

3  frying  cooking by immersion in hot fat at temperature 400 to 450
degrees fahrenheit  used for croquettes  etc 

if a fat thermometer is not available  test by using small pieces of
bread  put into heated fat 

a  for croquettes made from food requiring little cooking  such as
oysters  or from previously cooked mixtures  as rice  fish or meat
croquettes  bread should brown in one half minute 

b  for mixtures requiring cooking  as doughnuts  fritters  etc   bread
should brown in one minute 


combination methods

1  pot roasting  cooking (by use of steam from small amount of water)
tough cuts of meat which have been browned but not cooked thoroughly 

season meat  dredge with flour  sear in hot pan until well browned 
place oil rack in pot containing water to height of one inch  but do
not let water reach the meat  keep water slowly boiling  replenish as
needed with boiling water  this method renders tough cuts tender  but
requires several hours cooking 

2  stewing  a combination of methods which draws part of flavor into
gravy and retains part in pieces which are to be used as meat 

cut meat into pieces suitable for serving  cover one half of meat with
cold water  let stand one hour  bring slowly to boiling point  dredge
other half of meat with flour and brown in small amount of fat  add
to the other mixture and cook slowly 1 1/2 to 2 hours  or until tender 
adding diced vegetables  thickening and seasoning as desired one half
hour before cooking is finished 

3  fricasseeing  cooking in a sauce until tender  meat which has been
previously browned but not cooked throughout 

brown meat in small amount of fat  place in boiling water to cover 
cook slowly until tender  to 1 pint of water in which meat is cooked 
add 1/4 cup flour  1 teaspoon salt  1/4 teaspoon cayenne  and 1/4 cup
milk  thoroughly blended  when at boiling point  add one beaten egg  1
tablespoon chopped parsley and 1 tablespoon cold water well mixed  add
cooked meat and serve

the economy of meat and meat substitutes


don t buy more than your family actually needs  study and know what
the actual needs are  and you will not make unnecessary expenditures 

learn what the various cuts of meat are  what they can be used for 
and which are best suited to the particular needs of your household 

study the timeliness of buying certain cuts of meats  there are days
when prices are lower than normal 

always check the butcher s weights by watching him closely or by
weighing the goods on scales of your own 

always buy a definite quantity  ask what the pound rate is  and note
any fractional part of the weight  don t ask for  ten or twenty cents 
worth  

select your meat or fish personally  there is no doubt that high
retail prices are due to the tendency of many housewives to do their
buying by telephone or through their servants 

test the freshness of meat and fish  staleness of meat and fish is
shown by loose and flabby flesh  the gills of fresh fish are red and
the fins stiff 

make all the purchases possible at a public market  if you can walk
to it  or if carfare will not make too large an increase in the amount
you have set aside for the day s buying 

a food chopper can be made to pay for itself in a short time by the
great variety of ways it furnishes of utilizing left overs 

if possible  buy meat trimmings  they cost 20 cents a pound and can be
used in many ways 

buy the ends of bacon strips  they are just as nutritious as sliced
bacon and cost 50 per cent  less 

learn to use drippings in place of butter for cooking purposes 

buy cracked eggs  they cost much less than whole ones and are usually
just as good 

keep a stock pot  drop into it all left overs  these make an excellent
basis for soup stock 

don t throw away the heads and bones of fish  clean them and use them
with vegetables for fish chowder or cream of fish soup 

study attractive ways of serving food  plain  cheap  dishes can be
made appetizing if they look attractive on the table 

experiment with meat substitutes  cheese  dried vegetables and the
cheaper varieties of fish can supply all the nutriment of meat at a
much lower cost 

don t do your cooking  by guess   if the various ingredients are
measured accurately  the dish will taste better and cost less 

don t buy delicatessen food if you can possibly avoid it  delicatessen
meals cost 15 per cent  more than the same meals cooked at home  and
the food is not as nourishing  you pay for the cooking and the rent of
the delicatessen store  as well as the proprietor s profit 

don t pay five or ten cents more a dozen for white eggs in the belief
that they are superior to brown eggs  the food value of each is the
same  the difference in shell color is due to the breed of hen 

tell the butcher to give you the trimmings of chicken  i e   the head 
feet  fat and giblets  they make delicious chicken soup  the feet
contain gelatine  which gives soup consistency 

buy a tough  and consequently less expensive  chicken and make it
tender by steaming it for three hours before roasting 

don t put meat wrapped in paper into the ice box  as the paper tends
to absorb the juices 

try to find a way to buy at least a part of your meats and eggs direct
from the farm  you will get fresher  better food  and if it is sent by
parcels post it can usually be delivered to your table for much less
than city prices

fish as a meat substitute

as the main course at a meal  fish may be served accompanied by
vegetables or it may be prepared as a  one meal dish  requiring only
bread and butter and a simple dessert to complete a nutritious and
well balanced diet  a lack of proper knowledge of selection of fish
for the different methods of cooking  and the improper cooking of
fish once it is acquired  are responsible to a large extent for the
prejudice so frequently to be found against the use of fish 

the kinds of fish obtainable in different markets vary somewhat  but
the greatest difficulty for many housekeepers seems to be  to know
what fish may best be selected for baking  broiling  etc   and the
tests for fish when cooked  an invariable rule for cooking fish is
to apply high heat at first  until the flesh is well seared so as to
retain the juices  then a lower temperature until the flesh is cooked
throughout  fish is thoroughly cooked when the flesh flakes  for
broiling or pan broiling  roll fish in flour or cornmeal  preferably
the latter  which has been well seasoned with salt and cayenne  this
causes the outside to be crisp and also gives added flavor  leftover
bits of baked or other fish may be combined with white sauce or tomato
sauce  or variations of these sauces  and served as creamed fish  or
placed in a greased baking dish  crumbs placed on top and browned and
served as scalloped fish  fish canapes  fish cocktail  fish soup or
chowder  baked  steamed  broiled or pan broiled fish  entrees without
number  and fish salad give opportunity to use it in endless variety 

combined with starchy foods such as rice  hominy  macaroni  spaghetti
or potato  and accompanied by a green vegetable or fruit  the dish
becomes a meal  leftover bits may also be utilized for salad  either
alone with cooked or mayonaise salad dressing  or combined with
vegetables such as peas  carrots  cucumbers  etc  the addition of a
small amount of chopped pickle to fish salad improves its flavor  or
a plain or tomato gelatine foundation may be used as a basis for the
salad  the appended lists of fish suitable for the various methods
of cooking  and the variety in the recipes for the uses of fish 
have been arranged to encourage a wider use of this excellent meat
substitute  so largely eaten by european epicures  but too seldom
included in american menus  during the period of the war  the larger
use of fish is a patriotic measure in that it will save the beef 
mutton and pork needed for our armies

food will win the war don t waste it

vital importance to the conduct of the war  and without a very
conscientious elimination of waste and very strict economy in our food
consumption  we cannot hope to fulfill this primary duty

save sugar

 reasons why our government asks us to save sugar with practical
recipes for sugarless desserts  cakes  candies and preserves  


one ounce of sugar less per person  per day  is all our government
asks of us to meet the world sugar shortage  one ounce of sugar equals
two scant level tablespoonfuls and represents a saving that every man 
woman and child should be able to make  giving up soft drinks and the
frosting on our cakes  the use of sugarless desserts and confections 
careful measuring and thorough stirring of that which we place in our
cups of tea and coffee  and the use of syrup  molasses or honey on our
pancakes and fritters will more than effect this saving 

it seems but a small sacrifice  if sacrifice it can be called  when
one recognizes that cutting down sugar consumption will be most
beneficial to national health  the united states is the largest
consumer of sugar in the world  in 1916 germany s consumption was 20
lbs  per person per year  italy s 29 to 30 lbs   that of france 37 
of england 40  while the united states averaged 85 lbs  this enormous
consumption is due to the fact that we are a nation of candy eaters 
we spend annually $80 000 000 on confections  these are usually eaten
between meals  causing digestive disturbances as well as unwarranted
expense  sweets are a food and should be eaten at the close of the
meal  and if this custom is established during the war  not only
will tons of sugar be available for our allies  but the health of the
nation improved 

the average daily consumption of sugar per person in this country is 5
ounces  and yet nutritional experts agree that not more than 3 ounces
a day should be taken  the giving up of one ounce per day will 
therefore  be of great value in reducing many prevalent american
ailments  flatulent dyspepsia  rheumatism  diabetes  and stomach
acidity are only too frequently traced to an oversupply of sugar in
our daily diet 

most persons apparently think of sugar merely as a sweetening agent 
forgetting entirely the fact that it is a most concentrated food 
it belongs to what is called the carbohydrate group  upon which we
largely depend for energy and heat  it is especially valuable to
the person doing active physical work  the open air worker  or the
healthy  active  growing child  but should be used sparingly by other
classes of people  sugar is not only the most concentrated fuel food
in the dietary  but it is one that is very readily utilized in the
body  98 per cent  of it being available for absorption  while within
thirty minutes of the time it is taken into the system part of it is
available for energy 

as a food it must be supplied  especially to the classes of people
mentioned above  but as a confection it can well be curtailed  when it
is difficult to obtain  housekeepers must avail themselves of changed
recipes and different combinations to supply the necessary three
ounces per day and to gain the much desired sweet taste so necessary
to many of our foods of neutral flavor with which sugar is usually
combined 

our grandmothers knew how to prepare many dishes without sugar  in
their day lack of transportation facilities  of refining methods and
various economic factors made molasses  sorghum  honey  etc   the
only common methods of sweetening  but the housekeeper of to day knows
little of sweetening mediums except sugar  and sugar shortage is to
her a crucial problem  there are many ways  however  of getting around
sugar shortage and many methods of supplying the necessary food value
and sweetening 

by the use of marmalades  jams and jellies canned during the season
when the sugar supply was less limited  necessity for the use of sugar
can be vastly reduced  by the addition to desserts and cereals of
dried fruits  raisins  dates  prunes and figs  which contain large
amounts of natural sugar  the sugar consumption can be greatly
lessened  by utilizing leftover syrup from canned or preserved fruits
for sweetening other fruits  and by the use of honey  molasses  maple
sugar  maple syrup and corn syrup  large quantities of sugar may be
saved  the substitution of sweetened condensed milk for dairy milk
in tea  coffee and cocoa  in fact  in all our cooking processes where
milk is required  will also immeasurably aid in sugar conservation 
the substitutes mentioned are all available in large amounts  honey
is especially valuable for children  as it consists of the more simple
sugars which are less irritating than cane sugar  and there is no
danger of acid stomach from the amounts generally consumed 

as desserts are the chief factor in the use of quantities of sugar
in our diet  the appended recipes will be of value  as they deal with
varied forms of nutritious  attractive sugarless desserts  it is only
by the one ounce savings of each individual member of our great one
hundred million population that the world sugar shortage may be met 
and it is hoped every housekeeper will study her own time tested
recipes with the view of utilizing as far as possible other forms of
sweetening  in most recipes the liquid should be slightly reduced in
amount and about one fifth more of the substitute should be used than
the amount of sugar called for 

with a few tests along this line one will be surprised how readily
the substitution may be made  if all sweetening agents become scarce 
desserts can well be abandoned  served at the end of a full meal 
desserts are excess food except in the diet of children  where they
should form a component part of the meal

save fat

 reasons why our government asks us to save fat  with practical
recipes for fat conservation 


with the world wide decrease of animal production  animal fats are now
growing so scarce that the world is being scoured for new sources of
supply  our government has asked the housewife to conserve all the
fats that come to her home and utilize them to the best advantage  to
this end it is necessary to have some knowledge of the character of
different fats and the purposes to which they are best adapted 

the word fat usually brings to one s mind an unappetizing chunk of
meat fat which most persons cannot and will not eat  and fatty foods
have been popularly supposed to be  bad for us  and  hard to digest  
fats are  however  an important food absolutely essential to complete
nutrition  which repay us better for the labor of digestion than any
other food  if they are indigestible  it is usually due to improper
cooking or improper use  if they are expensive  it is merely because
they are extravagantly handled  the chief function of fatty food is
to repair and renew the fatty tissues  to yield energy and to maintain
the body heat  the presence of fat in food promotes the flow of the
pancreatic juice and bile  which help in the assimilation of other
foods and assist the excretory functions of the intestine  these are
badly performed if bile and other digestive fluids are not secreted in
sufficient quantity  the absence of fat in the diet leads to a state
of malnutrition  predisposing to tuberculosis  especially in children
and young persons 

it is claimed that the most serious food shortage in germany is fat 
that the civilian population is dying in large numbers because of
the lack of it  and that von hindenburg s men will lose out on the
basis of fat  rather than on the basis of munitions or military
organization  worst of all is the effect of fat shortage on the
children of the nation  leaders of thought all over europe assert
that even if germany wins  germany has lost  because it has sapped the
strength of its coming generation 

the term fat is used to designate all products of fatty composition
and includes liquid fats such as oils  soft fats such as butter  and
hard fats such as tallow  while all fats have practically the same
energy value  they differ widely from each other in their melting
point  and the difference in digestibility seems to correspond to the
difference in melting point  butter burns at 240 degrees fahrenheit 
while vegetable oils can be heated as high as 600 degrees fahrenheit 
furnishing a very high temperature for cooking purposes before they
begin to burn  the scorching of fat not only wastes the product  but
renders it indigestible  even dangerous to some people  and for this
reason butter should never be used for frying  as frying temperature
is usually higher than 240 degrees  it is well to choose for cooking
only those fats which have the highest heat resisting qualities
because they do not burn so easily 

beginning with the lowest burning point  fats include genuine butter 
substitute butters  lard and its substitutes  and end with tallow and
vegetable oils  of the latter  there is a varied selection from the
expensive olive oil to the cheaper cottonseed  peanut  cocoanut and
corn oils and their compounds and the hydrogenated oils 

the economy of fat  therefore  depends on the choice of the fat used
for the various cooking processes as well as the conservation of
all fatty residue  such as crackling  leftover frying fats and soup
fat  for cooking processes  such as sauteing (pan frying)  or deep
fat frying  it is best to use the vegetable and nut oils  these are
more plentiful  and hence cheaper than the animal fats  the latter 
however  can be produced in the home from the fats of meats and
leftover pan fats  which should not be overlooked as frying mediums 
butter and butter substitutes are best kept for table use and for
flavoring  the hydrogenated oils  home rendered fats  lard and beef
and mutton suet can be used for shortening fats 

in the purchase of meats  the careful housewife should see that
the butcher gives her all the fat she pays for  as all fats can be
rendered very easily at home and can be used for cooking purposes 
butchers usually leave as large a proportion of fat as possible on
all cuts of meat which  when paid for at meat prices  are quite an
expensive item  all good clear fat should  therefore  be carefully
trimmed from meats before cooking  few people either like or find
digestible greasy  fat meats  and the fat paid for at meat prices 
which could have been rendered and used for cooking  is wasted when
sent to table 

there are various methods of conserving fat  first  the economical use
of table fats  second  the saving of cooking  and third  the proper
use of all types of fat 

economy in the use of table fats may best be secured by careful
serving  one serving of butter is a little thing  there are about
sixty four of them in a pound  in many households the butter left on
the plates probably would equal a serving or one fourth of an ounce 
daily  which is usually scraped into the garbage pail or washed off in
the dishpan  but if everyone of our 20 000 000 households should waste
one fourth of an ounce of butter daily  it would mean 312 500 pounds
a day  or 114 062 500 pounds a year  to make this butter would take
265 261 560 gallons of milk  or the product of over a half million
cows  an item in national economy which should not be overlooked 

when butter is used to flavor cooked vegetables  it is more economical
to add it just before they are served rather than while they are
cooking  the flavor thus imparted is more pronounced  and  moreover 
if the butter is added before cooking  much of it will be lost in
the water unless the latter is served with the vegetables  butter
substitutes  such as oleomargarine and nut margarine  should be more
largely used for the table  especially for adults  conserve butter
for children  as animal fats contain vitamines necessary for growing
tissues  butter substitutes are as digestible and as nourishing as
butter  and have a higher melting point  they keep better and cost
less 

oleomargarine  which has been in existence for fifty years  was first
offered to the world in 1870 by a famous french chemist  mege mouries 
who was in search of a butter substitute cheap enough to supply the
masses with the much needed food element  he had noticed that the
children of the poor families were afflicted with rickets and other
diseases which could be remedied by the administration of the right
amount of fat  he combined fresh suet and milk and called the product
 oleomargarine   in the united states this product is now made of oleo
oil or soft beef fat  neutral lard  cottonseed and other oils  churned
with a small quantity of milk  and in the finer grades  cream is
sometimes used  a certain proportion of butter is usually added  and
the whole worked up with salt as in ordinary butter making 

owing to the fears of the butter makers that oleomargarine would
supplant their product in popular favor  legislation was enacted that
restricted the manufacture of oleo and established a rigid system of
governmental inspection  so that the product is now manufactured
under the most sanitary conditions which furnishes a cleaner and more
reliable product than natural butter 

nut margarine is a compound of cocoa oil  which so closely resembles
butter that only an expert can distinguish it from the natural
product  both these butter substitutes are used in large amounts by
the best bakers  confectioners and biscuit manufacturers  and foolish
prejudice against butter substitutes should not deter their use in the
home 

a large saving in cooking fats can be made by the careful utilization
of all fats that come into the home  beef and mutton suet can be
rendered and made available  fats which have been saved after meals
are cooked should be clarified  that is  freed from all objectionable
odors  tastes or color  so as to be made available as shortening and
frying fats 

the following recipes and suggestions make possible the use of all
fats  and as fat shortage is one of the most serious of the world s
food problems  it is essential that every housekeeper have a larger
knowledge of the utilization and economy of this essential food

to render fats


to render fat by direct method

run the fat through the household meat grinder or chop fine in the
chopping bowl  then heat in the double boiler until completely melted 
finally straining through a rather thick cloth or two thicknesses
of cheese cloth  wrung out in hot water  by this method there is no
danger of scorching  fats heated at a low temperature also keep better
than those melted at higher temperature  after the fat is rendered 
it should be slowly reheated to sterilize it and make sure it is free
from moisture  the bits of tissue strained out  commonly known as
cracklings  may be used for shortening purposes or may be added to
cornmeal which is to be used as fried cornmeal mush 


to render fat with milk

to two pounds of fat (finely chopped if unrendered) add one half pint
of milk  preferably sour  heat the mixture in a double boiler until
thoroughly melted  stir well and strain through a thick cloth or two
thicknesses of cheese cloth wrung out in hot water  when cold the fat
forms a hard  clean layer and any material adhering to the under
side of the fat  may be scraped off  sour milk being coagulated is
preferable to sweet milk since the curd remains on the cloth through
which the rendered mixture is strained and is thus more easily
separated from the rendered fat which has acquired some of the milk
flavor and butter fat 


to render fat by cold water method

cut fat in small pieces  cover with cold water  heat slowly  let cook
until bubbling ceases  press fat during heating so as to obtain all
the oil possible  when boiling ceases strain through cheesecloth and
let harden  if desired one half teaspoon salt  one eighth teaspoon
pepper  1 teaspoon onion and 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning may be added
before straining 


to render strong flavored fats

to mutton  duck or goose fat add equal amount of beef suet or
vegetable fat and render same as suet  this may then be used for
shortening  or pan broiling for meat or fish dishes  and not have the
characteristic taste of the stronger fats 

when rendering strong mutton  duck or goose fats if a small whole
onion is added the strong flavor of the fat is reduced  remove the
onion before straining  it may be used in cooking 


to clarify fat

melt the fat in an equal volume of water and heat for a short time at
a moderate temperature  stir occasionally  cool and remove the layer
of fat which forms on the top  scraping off any bits of meat or other
material which may adhere to the other side 

fats which have formed on top of soups  of cooked meats (such as pot
roast  stews)  salt meats (such as corned beef  ham  etc )  or strong
fats  such as from boiled mutton  poultry and game  may be clarified
in this way and used alone or combined with other animal or vegetable
fats in any savory dish 


care of fat after being used for cooking

if fat is used for deep fat frying as croquettes  doughnuts  fritters 
etc   while fat is still hot  add a few slices raw potato and allow it
to stay in the fat until it is cool  remove potato  strain fat  allow
to harden and it is ready to use  the potato absorbs odors from fat 


how to make savory fats

fat 1  to 1 pound of unrendered fat (chopped fine) add 1 slice of
onion about one half inch thick and two inches in diameter  1 bay
leaf  1 teaspoonful salt  and about one eighth teaspoonful of pepper 
render in a double boiler and strain 

fat 2  to 1 pound unrendered fat (chopped fine) add 2 teaspoonfuls
of thyme  1 slice onion  about one half inch thick and two inches
in diameter  one teaspoonful salt and about one eighth teaspoonful
pepper  render in a double boiler and strain 

fat 3  to 1 pound unrendered fat (chopped fine) add 1 teaspoonful
thyme  1 teaspoonful marjoram  one half teaspoonful rubbed sage  1
teaspoonful salt  and about one eighth teaspoonful pepper  render in a
double boiler and strain through fine cloth 


extension of table fats


a  butter or other fat may be extended to double its original bulk and
reduce the cost of the fat 40 per cent  a patented churn  any homemade
churn  mayonnaise mixer  or bowl and rotary beater may be used for
the purpose  to any quantity of butter heated until slightly soft add
equal quantity of milk  place in the churn  add one teaspoon salt for
each one pound of butter used  blend thoroughly in churn  mayonnaise
mixer  or in bowl with rotary beater until of even consistency  place
in refrigerator to harden  vegetable coloring  such as comes with
margarine or may be purchased separately  may be added if a deeper
yellow color is desired 


b 

  1 lb  butter
  1 quart milk (2 pint bottles preferred)
  1 tablespoon granulated gelatine
  1 1/2 teaspoons salt

soak gelatine in one half cup of the milk  when softened  dissolve
over hot water  let butter stand in warm place  until soft  add
gelatine mixture  milk and salt and beat with dover beater until
thoroughly mixed (about 15 minutes)  vegetable coloring such as comes
with margarine may be added if desired  do not put on ice 


c 

  1 lb  butter
  1 quart milk (2 pint bottles preferred)
  1 tablespoon granulated gelatine
  1 1/2 teaspoons salt
  1 cup peanut butter

soak gelatine in one half cup of the milk  when softened  dissolve
over hot water  let butter stand in warm place  until soft  add
gelatine mixture  peanut butter  milk and salt and beat with rotary
egg beater until thoroughly blended (about 15 minutes)  vegetable
coloring such as comes with margarine may be added if desired  put in
cool place to harden but do not put on ice as the gelatine would cause
the mixture to flake  it is preferable to make up this mixture enough
for one day at a time only 


d  to 1 pound of butter or butter substitute add one cup peanut
butter  blend thoroughly with wooden spoon or butter paddle  this may
be used in place of butter as a new and delightful variation 


e  to 1 pound softened butter add 1 pound softened butter substitute
(oleomargarine  nut margarine  vegetable margarine) or hydrogenated
fat  blend thoroughly with butter paddle or wooden spoon and use as
butter 




suggestions for pastry

whole wheat makes a more tasty crust than bread flour and all rye
pastry has even better flavor than wheat flour pastry  half wheat or
rye and the other half cornmeal (white or yellow) makes an excellent
pastry for meat or fish pie  if cornmeal is added  use this recipe

save food

 reasons why our government asks us not to waste food  with practical
recipes on the use of leftovers 


elimination of food waste is to day a patriotic service  it is also a
most effective method of solving our food problem  this country 
like all the powers at war  will undoubtedly be called upon to face
increasing prices so long as the war continues  and waste in any form
is not only needless squandering of the family income  but failure in
devotion to a great cause 

food waste is due to poor selection of raw materials  to careless
storage and heedless preparation  to bad cooking  to injudicious
serving  and to the overflowing garbage pail 

to select food in such a way as will eliminate waste and at the same
time insure the best possible return for money spent  the housekeeper
must purchase for nutriment rather than to please her own or the
family palate 

when eggs are sixty and seventy cents a dozen their price is out of
all proportion to their food value  tomatoes at five or ten cents
apiece in winter do not supply sufficient nutriment to warrant their
cost  nor does capon at forty five cents a pound nourish the body
any better than the fricassee fowl at twenty eight cents  in order
to prevent such costly purchasing  a knowledge of food values is
necessary  the simplest and easiest way to plan food values is to
divide the common food materials into five main groups and see that
each of these groups appear in each day s menu 

group 1   foods depended on for mineral matters  vegetable acids  and
body regulating substances 

fruits

  apples  pears  etc  
  berries 
  melons 
  oranges  lemons  all citrus fruits 

vegetables

  salads  lettuce  celery 
  potherbs or  greens 
  tomatoes  squash 
  green peas  green beans 
  potatoes and root vegetables 

group 2   foods depended on for protein 

  milk  skim milk  cheese 
  eggs 
  meat 
  poultry 
  fish 
  dried peas  beans  cow peas 
  nuts 

group 3   foods depended on for starch 

  cereals  grains  meals  flour 
  cereal breakfast foods 
  bread 
  crackers 
  macaroni and other pastes 
  cakes  cookies  starchy puddings 
  potatoes  other starchy vegetables 
  bananas 

group 4   foods depended on for sugar 

  sugar 
  molasses 
  syrups 
  dates 
  raisins 
  figs 

group 5   foods depended on for fat 

  butter and cream 
  lard  suet 
  salt pork and bacon 
  table and salad oils 
  vegetable  nut  and commercial cooking fats and oils 

if from each of these groups the housekeeper  when buying  chooses
the lowest cost food  she will provide the necessary nutriment for the
least expenditure of money  in war time such marketing is essential 

other causes of waste in food purchasing may be enumerated as follows 
ordering by telephone  this permits the butcher or grocer  who has
no time to make selection of foods  to send what comes ready to hand 
whereas if the housekeeper did her own selecting  she could take
advantage of special prices or  leaders   food sold at cost or nearly
cost to attract patronage 

buying out of season foods also makes marketing costly  through
lack of knowledge concerning the periods at which certain fruits and
vegetables are seasonable  and therefore cheaper and in best flavor 
housekeepers frequently pay exorbitant prices for poor flavored 
inferior products 

buying in localities where high rental and neighborhood standards
compel the shopkeeper to charge high prices  the consumer pays not
only for the rent and the plate glass windows  but for display of
out of season delicacies  game and luxury foods  markets should be
selected where food in season is sold  where cleanliness and careful
attention prevail rather than showy display 

many a dollar is foolishly spent for delicatessen foods  the retail
cost of ready prepared foods includes a fraction of the salary of the
cook and the fuel  as well as the regular percentage of profit  the
food  also  is not so nourishing or flavorsome as if freshly cooked in
the home kitchen 

buying perishable foods in larger quantities than can be used
immediately  too frequently meats  fish  eggs  vegetables  milk and
cream are purchased in quantities larger than needed for immediate
consumption  and lack of knowledge of use of left overs causes what is
not eaten to be discarded 

buying non perishable foods in small quantities instead of in bulk 
food costs on an average 50 to 75 per cent  more when purchased in
small quantities  select a grocer who keeps his goods in sanitary
condition and who will sell in bulk  then do your purchasing from him
on a large scale and extend the sanitary care to your own storeroom 

buying foods high in price but low in food value  asparagus  canned
or fresh  is not as nourishing  for instance  as canned corn or beans 
strawberries out of season do not compare with dates  figs or raisins
which are to be had at all times 

buying without planning menus  by this carelessness foods are often
purchased which do not combine well  and therefore do not appeal
to the appetite  and so are wasted  unplanned meals also lead to an
unconscious extravagance in buying and an unnecessary accumulation of
left overs 

buying foreign brands when domestic brands are cheaper and often
better 

leaving the trimmings from meats and poultry at the butcher s  bring
these home and fry out the fatty portions for dripping  use all other
parts for the stock pot 

having purchased for nutriment and in sufficiently large quantities to
secure bulk rates  careful storage is the next step in the prevention
of waste  flour  cereals and meals become wormy if they are not kept
in clean  covered utensils and in a cool place  milk becomes sour 
especially in summer  this can be prevented by scalding it as soon
as received  cooling quickly  and storing in a cold place in covered 
well scalded receptacles  sour milk should not be thrown out  it
is good in biscuits  gingerbread  salad dressings  cottage cheese 
pancakes or waffles  and bread making 

meats should not be left in their wrappings  much juice soaks into the
paper  which causes a loss of flavor and nutriment  store all meat in
a cool place and do not let flies come in contact with it 

bread often molds  especially in warm  moist weather  trim off moldy
spots and heat through  keep the bread box sweet by scalding and
sunning once a week 

cheese molds  keep in a cool  dry place  if it becomes too dry for
table use  grate for sauces or use in scalloped dishes 

winter vegetables wilt and dry out  store in a cool place  if cellar
space permits  place in box of sand  sawdust or garden earth 

potatoes and onions sprout  cut off the sprouts as soon as they appear
and use for soup  soak  before using  vegetables which have sprouted 

fruits must be stored carefully so as to keep the skins unbroken 
broken spots in the skin cause rapid decay  do not permit good fruit
to remain in contact with specked or rotted fruit  stored fruit should
be looked over frequently and all specked or rotted fruit removed 
sweet potatoes are an exception  picking over  aggravates the trouble 
see that these vegetables are carefully handled at all times  if rot
develops  remove only those that can be reached without danger of
bruising the sound roots  sweet potatoes may also be stored like fruit
by spreading over a large surface and separating the tubers so that
they do not touch each other 

berries should be picked over as soon as received and spread on a
platter or a large surface to prevent crushing and to allow room for
circulation of air 

lettuce and greens wilt  wash carefully as soon as received and use
the coarse leaves for soup  shake the water from the crisp portions
and store in a paper bag in a cold refrigerator 

lemons when cut often grow moldy before they are used  when lemons are
spoiling  squeeze out the juice  make a syrup of one cup of sugar and
one cup of water  boil ten minutes and add lemon juice in any amount
up to one cup  bring to boiling point and bottle for future use  this
bottled juice may be used for puddings  beverages  etc  if only a
small amount of juice is needed  prick one end of a lemon with a fork 
squeeze out the amount needed and store the lemon in the ice box 

when we come to waste caused by careless preparation we may be
reminded of the miracle of the loaves and fishes  how all the guests
were fed and then twelve baskets were gathered up  often after
preparation that which is gathered up to be thrown away is as large in
quantity and as high in food value as the portions used 

vegetables are wasted in preparation by too thick paring  the
discarding of coarse leaves such as are found on lettuce  cabbage and
cauliflower  discarding wilted parts which can be saved by soaking 
throwing away tips and roots of celery and the roots and ends of
spinach and dandelions  all these waste products can be cooked tender 
rubbed through a sieve and used with stock for vegetable soup  or with
skimmed milk for cream soup  such products are being conserved by
the enemy  even to the onion skin  which is ground into bread making
material 

throwing away the water in which vegetables have been cooked wastes
their characteristic and valuable element  the mineral salts  cooking
them so much that they become watery  under cooking so that they
are hard and indigestible  cooking more than is required for a meal 
failing to use left over portions promptly as an entree or for cream
soups or scalloped dishes  all these things mean an appalling waste of
valuable food material  good food material is also lost when the water
in which rice or macaroni or other starchy food has been boiled is
poured down the kitchen sink  such water should be used for soup
making 

fruits are wasted by throwing away the cores and skins  which can be
used for making sauces  jams and jellies  the latter being sweetened
with corn syrup instead of sugar 

rhubarb is wasted by removing the pink skin from young rhubarb  which
should be retained to add flavor and color attractiveness to the dish 

raw food in quantity is frequently left in the mixing bowl  while
by the use of a good flexible knife or spatula every particle can
be saved  a large palette knife is as good in the kitchen as in the
studio 

                                        

the next step in food preparation is cooking  and tons of valuable
material are wasted through ignorance of the principles of cooking 

bad cooking  which means under cooking  over cooking or flavorless
cooking  renders food inedible  and inedible food contributes to world
shortage  fats are wasted in cooking by being burned and by not being
carefully utilized as dripping and shortening  the water in which salt
meat  fresh meat  or poultry has been boiled should be allowed to cool
and the fat removed before soup is made of it  such fat can be used 
first of all  in cooking  and then any inedible portions can be used
in soap making 

                                        

tough odds and ends of meat not sightly enough to appear on the table
are often wasted  they can be transformed by long cooking into savory
stews  ragouts  croquettes and hashes  whereas  if carelessly and
insufficiently cooked  they are unpalatable and indigestible  scraps
of left over cooked meat should be ground in the food chopper and made
into appetizing meat balls  hashes or sandwich paste  if you happen to
have a soft cooked egg left over  boil it hard at once  it can be used
for garnishes  sauces  salads or sandwich paste 

                                        

use all bits of bread  that cannot be used as toast  in puddings 
croquettes  scalloped dishes or to thicken soup 

                                        

don t throw away cold muffins and fancy breads  split and toast them
for next day s breakfast 

                                        

foods that survive the earlier forms of waste are often lost at table
by the serving of portions of like size to all members of the family 
the individual food requirements differ according to age  sex 
vocation and state of health  each should be considered before the
food is served  then there will be no waste on the plates when the
meal is over  the following table  showing the daily requirement of
calories for men and women in various lines of work  illustrates this
point 

  women               calories
  sedentary work        2 400
  active work           2 700
  hard manual labor     3 200

  men               calories
  sedentary work        2 700
  active work           3 450
  hard manual labor     4 150

although the serving of food should be carefully planned so as to
prevent waste  care should be taken that growing children have ample
food  it is a mistake to suppose that a growing child can be nourished
on less than a sedentary adult  a boy of fourteen who wants to eat
more than his father probably needs all that he asks for  we must not
save on the children  but it will be well to give them plain food for
the most part  which will not tempt them to overeat  and tactfully
combat pernickety  overfastidious likes and dislikes 

the united states food administration is preaching the gospel of the
clean plate  and this can be accomplished by serving smaller portions 
insisting that all food accepted be eaten  by keeping down bread
waste  cutting the bread at the table a slice at a time as needed  by
cooking only sufficient to supply moderately the number to be fed  and
no more  it is a false idea of good providing that platters must leave
the table with a generous left over  waste of cooked food is a serious
item in household economy  and no matter how skillfully leftovers are
utilized  it is always less expensive and more appetizing to provide
fresh cooked foods at each meal 

one would think that with the various uses to which all kinds of
foodstuffs may be put that there would be little left for the yawning
garbage pail  but the secretary of the united states department of
agriculture is responsible for the statement that $750 000 000 worth
of food has been wasted annually in the american kitchen  undoubtedly
a large part of this wastefulness was due to ignorance on the part of
the housewife  and the rest of it to the lack of co operation on
the part of the employees who have handled the food but not paid the
bills 

according to a well known domestic scientist  the only things which
should find their way to the garbage pail are 

  egg shells  after being used to clear coffee 
  potato skins  after having been cooked on the potato 
  banana skins  if there are no tan shoes to be cleaned 
  bones  after having been boiled in soup kettle 
  coffee grounds  if there is no garden where they can be used for
          fertilizer  or if they are not desired as filling for
          pincushions 
  tea leaves  after every tea serving  if they are not needed for
          brightening carpets or rugs when swept 
  asparagus ends  after being cooked and drained for soup 
  spinach  etc   decayed leaves and dirty ends of roots 

if more than this is now thrown away  you are wasting the family
income and not fulfilling your part in the great world struggle  your
government says that it is your business to know what food your family
needs to be efficient  that you must learn how to make the most of
the foods you buy  that it is your duty to learn the nature and uses
of various foods and to get the greatest possible nourishment out of
every pound of food that comes to your home 

the art of utilizing left overs is an important factor in this
prevention of waste  the thrifty have always known it  the careless
have always ignored it  but now as a measure of home economy as well
as a patriotic service  the left over must be handled intelligently 

the following recipes show how to make appetizing dishes from products
that heretofore in many homes have found their way to the extravagant
pail 

in these recipes  sauces are prominent because they are of great
value in making foods of neutral flavor  especially the starchy winter
vegetables  and rice  macaroni and hominy  as attractive as they are
nutritious  salads are included  since these serve to combine odds
and ends of meats and vegetables  gelatine dishes are provided because
gelatine serves as a binder for all kinds of leftovers and is an
extremely practical way of making the most rigid saving acceptable 
desserts made of crumbs of bread and cake  or left over cereals  are
among the major economies if they are worked out in such a way that
they do not involve the extravagant use of other foodstuffs  all the
recipes in this economy cook book have been thoughtfully adapted to
the conditions of the time  and will show the practical housekeeper
how to supply wholesome  flavorsome food for the least cost

soups utilize leftovers


in nearly every case when meat is purchased  some bone is paid for 
too frequently this is either left at the market or thrown away in
the home  bones  gristle  tough ends  head and feet of chickens  head 
fins and bones of fish  etc   should be utilized for making soup 

if a meat or fish chowder with plenty of vegetable accompaniment is
served  no other meat is required for the usual home meal 

if a cream of dried or fresh vegetables  or a meat stock soup with
plenty of vegetables or cereal content  is served  the amount of meat
eaten with the main course of the meal will be materially lessened 

soups may be a most economical method of using water in which meat 
fish or vegetables have been cooked  also of utilizing small portions
of leftover meats  fish  vegetables or cereal 

cream soups are made by cooking vegetables or cereal  then utilizing
the water in which they are cooked as part of the liquid for the soup 
outer parts or wilted parts of vegetables may be utilized for soups
instead of being discarded  water in which ham or mutton has been
boiled makes an excellent basis for dried or fresh vegetable soups

and kind make little difference so long as the mixture is allowed to
simmer for several hours and is properly seasoned

of our men we ask their lives  of ourselves  a little less food 




save and serve


to save bread  serve bread or rolls made from corn  rye or from coarse
flours  use breakfast foods and hot cakes  composed of corn  oatmeal 
buckwheat  rice or hominy  serve no toast as garniture or under meat 
serve war breads  use every part of the bread  either fresh or stale 
for puddings and toast  or dried and sifted for baked croquettes  or
use to extend flour in the making of muffins and drop cakes 

to save meat  use more chicken  hare  rabbits  duck  goose  lobster 
oysters  clams and egg and cheese dishes of all kinds  use less beef 
mutton  and pork and serve smaller portions at table of these meats 
have fewer of these items on the menu  provide more entrees and
made over dishes in which a smaller quantity of meat is extended by
the use of potatoes  rice  hominy  etc  use beans  as they contain
nearly the same nutritive value as meat  serve bacon only as a dish
and not as a garniture  and this way not more than once a week  use
cheese  dried vegetables and nuts  use fish and meat chowders  use
meat extension dishes  serve vegetable dinners 

to save sugar  use less candy and sweet drinks  use honey  maple
sugar  corn syrup  molasses and dark syrups with hot cakes and waffles
and in all cooking  in order to save butter and sugar  use all classes
of fruit preserves  jam  marmalades and jellies  do not frost or ice
cakes  serve dried fruits with cereals  and no sugar is needed 

to save fats  serve as few fried dishes as possible  so as to
save both butter and lard  and in any event use vegetable oils for
frying  that is  olive oil  corn oil  cottonseed oil  vegetable oil
compounds  etc  trim all coarse fats from meats before cooking and use
the waste fats for shortening and for soap  we are short of soap fats
as our supplies of tropical oils used for soap making are reduced  do
not waste soap  save fat from soup stock and from boiled meats  use
butter substitutes where possible 

to save milk  use it all  buy whole milk and let cream rise  use this
cream  and you secure your milk without cost  economize on milk and
cream except for children  serve buttermilk  serve cottage cheese
regularly in varying forms  it is especially nutritious  use skimmed
milk in cooking  a great quantity of it goes to waste in this country 
use cheese generally  the children must have milk whole  therefore
reduce the use of cream 

use vegetables  use more vegetables and potatoes  make fruits and
vegetables into salads and attractive dishes  feature vegetable
dinners and salads of all kinds  encourage the use of cheese with
salads  make all types of salads from vegetables  we have a great
surplus of vegetables  and they can be used by substituting them for
staples so that the staples most needed will be saved 

make all kinds of vegetable soups  especially the cream soups  in
which the waste from staple vegetables  such as outer leaves and
wilted parts  can be utilized  these are wholesome and nutritious and
save meat
